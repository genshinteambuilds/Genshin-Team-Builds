# Cleanser

Characters that can cleanse, sometimes referred to as **Cleansers**, refer to characters that have the ability to inflict themselves or other members of their team with an elemental status.

This can sometimes be used to remove unwanted debuffs on your own characters that can occur when attempting some of Genshin Impact's more challenging content such as Domains and Spiral Abyss, typically due to a Ley Line Disorder that periodically affects the entire Domain or Floor.

Debuffs that can affect your characters are listed in the Abyss helper guide [here](https://genshinhelper.gitbook.io/abyss/mechanics/debuffs).

## How it works

A Ley Line disorder can be specified on entry to a Domain or Floor in Spiral Abyss. For example, the Ley Line Disorder given by the Forsaken Rift Domain (Domain of Mastery: Frosted Altar IV) reads:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/cleanse\_disorder copy.png>)

Here is an example of the Ley Line Disorder in action, afflicting our characters with **Cryo** and increasing our stamina consumption. No **Cryo** damage is taken when the status is inflicted.

This debuff inflicts all your characters with **Cryo** and is displayed both above the health bar as in the image above as well as on the character listing on the right of the screen as shown below.

Using some character's **Elemental Skills** or **Elemental Bursts** can inflict characters with another elemental status which can then react with the Ley Line Disorder element that is already affecting the character. This causes an **Elemental Reaction** to occur but also removes the debuff from the Ley Line Disorder.

{% hint style="info" %}
Some **Elemental Reactions** caused when removing the debuff may be detrimental to your party. For example, using Barbara's **Elemental Skill** in the example above would inflict **Hydro** on the active character, removing the debuff but also causing the character to become **Frozen**.
