# Crowd Control

Crowd Control, commonly abbreviated as CC, refers to the ability to control enemy movement. Crowd Control Support characters can use their Elemental Skills, Elemental Bursts or help setup Elemental Reactions that can affect enemy movement in three ways:

## Grouping

Also called Clumping, Pulling or Mobbing, refers to the ability to pull multiple enemies together. This allows characters to easily attack multiple enemies at once rather than needing to attack them one by one.

This type of Crowd Control is is common among Anemo Support characters. It should be noted that this kind of Crowd Control works best against smaller enemies and the speed at which enemies are grouped up depends on the level of the character using the ability relative to the level of the enemy. Larger enemies like Mitachurls and Ruin Guards will either resist the effects of Grouping Crowd Control, or ignore them altogether.

## Immobilization

Immobilization restricts enemy movement leaving them immobile and normally completed exposed to any form of damage. Damage may free the enemy from the Crowd Control depending on the exact ability used to immobilize them in the first place and the damage types or weapon type being used.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Frozen Elemental Reaction \(Cryo + Hydro\) is one form of Immobilization Crowd Control. Any teams with both a Cryo and a Hydro character will have the ability to freeze enemies. This can affect every enemy except bosses meaning enemies that would normally be a threat will be harmless and immobile so long as they are frozen.   
  
Any other Elemental Reactions from other elements besides Hydro, Cryo and Anemo and Heavy Attacks \(Claymore/Plunge Attacks/Explosions/Geo Element\) will break the freeze. With certain teams compositions, you can keep an enemy permanently frozen in place.
{% endhint %}

## Taunting <a id="taunt"></a>

Taunting commonly comes in the form of an Elemental Skill. It directs the enemy's focus onto a secondary object, relieving your character of damage and creating a pocket of breathing room. This CC is highly valuable in defense objectives such as protect the monolith. Taunts rely on enemies to gather around the taunt, rendering it less effective than other forms of CC due to a taunt's limited range. Taunts do not affect enemies out of its range \(Hilichurl Archers\) or Boss enemies.
