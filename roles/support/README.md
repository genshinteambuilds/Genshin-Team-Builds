# Support

Support Characters are characters that help out the team by providing useful abilities other than damage. This can come in the form of healing the other team members or by grouping up scattered enemies so that other characters can deal damage to all of the enemies at once and so on.

{% hint style="info" %}
Support as a term is incredibly loose within the Genshin Impact community. Often, Sub DPS characters are _**also**_ called support characters or **Enablers** if they provide useful elemental applications for the Main DPS to take advantage of.
