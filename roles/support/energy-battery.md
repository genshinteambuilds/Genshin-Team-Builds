# Energy Battery

Energy Battery characters, often just shortened to **Battery**, are those that can generate **Energy Particles** or **Orbs** for other members of the team. This is usually done through use of their **Elemental Skill** which will generate energy when it hits an enemy which will fill up the **Elemental Burst** gauge for your entire party.\
\
When you collect energy particles or orbs, certain characters in your party will gain more energy than the others. Characters that match the element of the particle or orb will gain the more energy compared to those that aren't. Characters that are also active / on-field also gain more energy than those that are off-field. If you want a specific character to gain the most energy from any energy generated, you can switch to that character to collect them.

Due to characters receiving severely reduced energy for off-element energy particles or orbs, characters are normally only called Energy Batteries or operating in that role when they are used in a supporting role and generating particles for another character in the team of the same element.

For a full breakdown on how energy and the **Energy Recharge** stat works. Check out the [references ](energy-battery.md#references)below.

Using **Sacrificial** or **Favonius** weapons can help Energy Battery characters generate even more energy for your team. **Sacrificial** weapons can reset the cool down of your character's abilities allowing them to use them again immediately to generate twice the number of energy particles of that element. **Favonius** weapons can generate additional neutral energy particles on **Critical Hits** letting them recharge any character on the team efficiently.

## Characters commonly used as an Energy Battery

{% hint style="info" %}
This is a non-exhaustive list. Any character that generates energy off their **Elemental Skill** can be used as a Battery although those that are commonly called batteries tend to have short cool downs on their **Elemental Skill** as well so that they can generate more energy for their teams.
