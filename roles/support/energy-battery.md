# Energy Battery

Energy Battery characters, often just shortened to Battery, are those that can generate energy particles for other members of the team. This is usually done through use of their Elemental Skill which will create energy particles when it hits an enemy which will fill up the Elemental Burst gauge for your entire party.  
  
When you collect energy particles certain characters in your party will gain more energy than the others. Characters that are the matching element of the energy particle will gain the more energy compared to those that aren't. Characters that are also active / on-field also gain more energy than those that are off-field. If you want a specific character to gain the most energy from any energy particles generated, you can switch to that character to collect them.

Due to characters receiving severely reduced energy for off-element energy particles, characters are normally only called Energy Batteries or operating in that role when they are used in a supporting role, and generating particles for another character in the team of the same element.

For a full breakdown on how energy particles and the energy recharge stat works. Check out the [references ](energy-battery.md#references)below.

Using Sacrificial or Favonius weapons can help Energy Battery characters generate even more energy for your team. Sacrificial weapons can reset the cool down of your character's abilities allowing them to use them again immediately to generate twice the number of energy particles of that element. Favonius weapons can generate additional neutral energy particles on Critical Hits letting them recharge any character on the team efficiently.

## Characters commonly used as an Energy Battery

{% hint style="info" %}
This is a non-exhaustive list. Any character that generates energy off their Elemental Skill can be used as a Battery although those that are commonly called batteries tend to have short cool downs on their Elemental Skill as well so that they can generate more energy for their teams.
