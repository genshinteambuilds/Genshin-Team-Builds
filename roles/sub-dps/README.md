# Sub DPS

A Sub DPS character is one that deals a large amount of damage through one of two different mechanisms:

* The character deals damage in a very short window of time through use of their **Elemental Skill** and **Elemental Burst** abilities. i.e. **Burst **Sub DPS
* The character deals damage while not being the active character. i.e. **Off-Field** Sub DPS

These characters are similar in that they do not rely on being active on the field for a long period of time in order to deal damage. Typical use of them involves swapping to the character, unloading their abilities and then swapping to a different character.

Terminology within Genshin Impact is fluid and constantly changing. Sometimes, you may see Sub DPS categorized as Support characters or Enablers as well since they may be "supporting" the Main DPS by providing useful elemental applications for the Main DPS to take advantage of.
