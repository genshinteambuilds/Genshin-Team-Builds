# Yunjin

## Roles

* **Off-Field DPS** (Elemental Burst)
* **Support:** Buffer

## Character Breakdown

* **Elemental Skill** provides a brief shield based off of her total **HP**, which lasts until her **Elemental Skill** is released. Based on the time spent charging her **Elemental Skill**, it would release the attack at either Charge Level 1 or 2, which scales off her **DEF**.
  * **A1** allows her **Elemental Skill** to immediately jump to **Charge Level 2** if it is pressed the moment she is attacked.
* **Elemental Burst** deals **AoE Geo DMG** around her and buffs party members in the team. When the active character deals **Normal Attack** **DMG** to enemies, additional **DMG** will be dealt based on Yunjin's current **DEF**, which lasts for 12s or until the buff has been triggered 30 times.
  * **A4** increases the **Normal Attack** **DMG Bonus** buff based on the number of different **Elemental** characters in the party.

## Additional Notes

* **C2** further buffs **Normal Attack** **DMG** by 15% for 12s, making it a very useful constellation to aim for.
* **C4** buffs her own **DEF**, allowing her to buff **Normal Attack** **DMG** even further.
* **C6** buffs **ATK SPD** for characters that are affected by her **Elemental Burst**.
* While her **A4** provides buff from multiple different **Elemental** characters, having 2/3 different ones is sufficient.
* Yunjin's **Elemental Burst** cannot snapshot. Hence, it cannot retain Gorou's **DEF** buff.

## **Works Well With**

* Characters that are focused on **Normal Attacks** are very effective with Yunjin.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_hutao.png)

* While Hutao primarily uses **Charged Attacks**, her typical rotation still uses 2 **Normal Attacks** for every 1 **Charged Attack**.
* Yunjin can also fill in the 2nd slot for **Geo Resonance**.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_xingqiu.png)

* Xingqiu synergises well with Yunjin as **Normal Attacks** trigger his **Elemental Burst** sword rain attacks.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_icon\_geo.webp)

* Most **Geo** characters can work well Yunjin as they are able to provide **DEF** buffs and provide **Geo Resonance**.

## **Does Not Work Well With**

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_ganyu.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_itto.png)

* Characters that are focused on **Charged Attacks** are generally ineffective with Yunjin as she only buffs **Normal Attack DMG**.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_raiden\_shougun.png)

* As Raiden's **Elemental Burst** attacks are considered **Elemental Burst DMG**, it is not buffed by Yunjin's **Elemental Burst**.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_eula.png)

* The majority of Eula's damage comes from her **Elemental Burst**. Hence, Yunjin only buffs a minor component of Eula's damage.
* C6 Yunjin allows Eula to gain more charges on Lightfall Sword.
