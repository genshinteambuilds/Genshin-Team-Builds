# Yunjin

## Roles

* **Sub DPS**
* **Support:** Buffer

## Character Breakdown

* **Elemental Skill** provides a brief shield based off of her total **HP**, which lasts until her **Elemental Skill** is released. Based on the time spent charging her **Elemental Skill**, it would release the attack at either **Charge Level** **1** or **2**, which scales off her **DEF**.
  * **A1** allows her **Elemental Skill** to immediately jump to **Charge Level 2** if it is pressed the moment she is attacked.
* **Elemental Burst** deals **AoE Geo Damage** around her and buffs party members in the team. When dealing **Normal Attack** damage to enemies, bonus damage will be dealt based on Yunjin's **DEF**, which lasts for 12s or until the buff has been triggered 30 times.
  * **A4** increases the **Normal Attack** damage buff based on the number of different **Elemental** characters in the party.

## Additional Notes

* **C2** further buffs **Normal Attack** damage by 15% for 12s, making it a very useful constellation to aim for.
