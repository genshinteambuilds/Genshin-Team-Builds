# Gorou

## **Roles**

* **Support:** Buffer, Healer (C4)

## **Character Breakdown**

* **Elemental Skill** causes Gorou sets up a war banner that deals AoE **Geo DMG** and provides a number of buffs to the whole team depending on the amount of **Geo** characters in the party.
  * 1 **Geo** character: Adds "Standing Firm" - **DEF** Bonus.
  * 2 **Geo** characters: Adds "Impregnable" - Increased resistance to interruption.
  * 3 **Geo** characters: Adds "Crunch" - **Geo DMG Bonus**.
* **Elemental Burst** deals AoE **Geo DMG** and creates a field around the active character and periodically deals **Geo DMG** and pulls in a **Crystallize** shard toward the active character. This field provides the same buffs that Gorou's **Elemental Skill** provides.
  * Casting **Elemental Burst** will destroy any active war banners.
* **A1** increases party's **DEF**% after Gorou casts **Elemental Burst**.
* **A4** increases Gorou's **Elemental Skill** and **Elemental Burst DMG** by a percentage of his **DEF**.

## **Additional Notes**

* Gorou focuses on buffing the **DEF** of other characters, mainly **Geo** characters.
* Gorou ideally wants to be paired with at least 2 other **Geo** characters for the party to benefit from all the buffs he is able to provide.
* **C1** reduces **Elemental Burst** cooldown when **Geo DMG** occurs during **Elemental Burst**.
* **C2** extends **Elemental Burst** uptime when active characters obtain a **Crystallize** shard.
* **C4** heals the active character based on his **DEF** periodically when "Impregnable" or "Crunch" buffs are active.
* **C6** provides a **CRIT DMG** Buff on any **Geo DMG** dealt by characters buffed by Gorou's **Elemental Skill** or **Elemental Burst**.

## **Works Well With**

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Itto.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Noelle.png)

* Itto and Noelle are both **DEF** scaling Main DPS units and benefit greatly from all of Gorou's party buffs. They are the best units to pair with Gorou.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Albedo.png)

* Albedo also benefits greatly from Gorou's buffs and is an off-field unit that can normally fill the 3rd **Geo** character requirement to unlock the last level of Gorou's buffs.

* Gorou is a specialized support unit that is able to benefit most **Geo** main DPS.

## **Does Not Work Well With**

* Gorou unfortunately does not work well with units outside of **Geo**. No other Main DPS scales with **DEF** and if they don't deal **Geo DMG,** they do not benefit from a number of Gorou's buffs.

Itto only works in a **Geo** team where he performs as a Selfish Main DPS. A couple common example teams are shown below. Additional teams and options can be found in the **Geo** team page.

* A strong team composition that takes full advantage of Gorou's party buffs to **DEF** and **Geo** **DMG**. Having 4 **Geo** characters lowers the energy recharge requirements across the whole team.

* Another example of a full **Geo** team composition. Not recommended unless Noelle is C6.
