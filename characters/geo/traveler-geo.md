# Traveler (Geo)

## Roles

* **Burst DPS**
* **Support:** Buffer (C1)
* **Main DPS**

## Character Breakdown

* **Elemental Skill** **(Tap)** summons a meteorite from the ground that deals **Geo** **DMG**. The meteorite is a **Geo Construct**.
  * A maximum of 3 **Geo Constructs** can exist at the same time before the earliest summon is destroyed.
    * **Elemental Skill (Hold)** lets you control where to summon the meteorite.
    * **C2** causes meteorites to deal **Geo DMG** when destroyed.
* **Elemental Burst** creates shockwaves that deal **Geo** **DMG** and erects a barrier at the edge of the shockwaves. The barrier is considered a **Geo** **Construct**.
  * **C1** increases **CRIT Rate** and resistance to interruptions of the characters inside the radius of the barrier.
  * **C4** causes the Traveler (Geo) to recover 5 Energy for every enemy hit by their **Elemental Burst**. A maximum of 25 energy can be recovered.

## Additional Notes

* Often paired with another **Geo** character to both provide energy to them and also to gain increased energy to maintain **Elemental Burst** uptime. This pairing also causes **Geo Resonance**, buffing the **Geo DMG** of both users.
* **C6** increases the duration of the summoned meteorite by 10 seconds and the barrier created by their **Elemental Burst** for an additional 5 seconds.

## Works Well With

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_icon\_geo.webp)

* Traveler (Geo) is almost always paired with a 2nd **Geo** character to activate **Geo Resonance** to further increase the **Geo** **DMG** dealt to enemies.
* Zhongli allows **Geo Constructs** to resonate with the Stone Stele summoned by Zhongliâ€™s **Elemental Skill** to additional Off-Field Geo **DMG**. Traveler (Geo) also acts as an Energy Battery for Zhongli since they can consistently produce **Geo Energy Particles** with their **Elemental Skill**.

* Bennett's **Elemental Burst** provides healing and a massive **ATK** buff, making him a recommended character in most teams.

* Characters with strong Off-Field **DMG** can be easily utilized in **Geo**-focused teams, which Traveler (Geo) typically appear in.

## Does Not Work Well With

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_icon\_cryo.webp)

* **Geo** **DMG** triggers the **Shatter** reaction stopping enemies from being **Frozen**, which results in disrupting **Freeze**-based teams.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_icon\_anemo.webp)

* **Geo** cannot take advantage of **Viridescent Venerer** 4-set effect. **Anemo** does not provide anything for Traveler (Geo) aside from Crowd Control.

* A team that uses Ningguang as the Main DPS with Traveler (Geo) acting as another source of **Energy Particles** and activates **Geo Resonance**. Traveler (Geo) is used in quick windows, deploying their **Elemental Skill** for **Energy Particle** generation and their **Elemental Burst** to provide buffs to other party members.

* Focuses on raw **Pyro** **DMG** with Klee. Traveler (Geo) and Zhongli provide **Geo Resonance** along with shielding and a small amount of Off-Field **Geo DMG.**
* Bennett acts as a healer and buffer and activates **Pyro Resonance** with Klee for extra **ATK**.
