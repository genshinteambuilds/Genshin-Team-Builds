# Traveler (Geo)

## Roles

* **Burst DPS**
* **Support:** Buffer (C1)
* **Main DPS**

## Character Breakdown

* **Elemental Skill** **(Tap)** summons a meteorite from the ground that deals **Geo** damage. The meteorite is a **Geo Construct**.
  * A maximum of 3 meteorites can exist at the same time before the earliest summon is destroyed.
    * **Elemental Skill (Hold)** lets you control where to summon the meteorite.
    * **C2 **causes meteorites to deal damage when destroyed.
* **Elemental Burst** creates shockwaves that deal **Geo** damage and erects a barrier at the edge of the shockwaves. The barrier is considered a **Geo** **Construct**.
  * **C1** increases **Crit Rate** and resistance to interruptions of the characters inside the radius of the barrier.
  * **C4** causes the Traveler (Geo) to recover 5 energy for every enemy hit by their **Elemental Burst**. A maximum of 25 energy can be recovered.

## Additional Notes

* Often paired with another **Geo** character to both provide energy to them and also to gain increased energy to maintain** Elemental Burst **uptime. This pairing also causes **Geo Resonance**, greatly increasing the damage of both users.
* **C6** increases the duration of the summoned meteorite by 10 seconds and the barrier created by their **Elemental Burst **for an additional 5 seconds.

## Works Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Zhongli.png)

* Traveler (Geo) is almost always paired with Zhongli to have their **Geo Constructs** resonate with the stele generated by Zhongli’s **Elemental Skill **to additional damage. He also enables **Geo Resonance **to further increase the damage done. Traveler (Geo) also acts as an Energy Battery for Zhongli since they can consistently produce **Energy Particles** with their **Elemental Skill**.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Ningguang.png)

* An alternative to Zhongli, Ningguang offers a more DPS-focused kit. Similar to Zhongli, Ningguang enables **Geo Resonance **and the two characters can provide each other with energy.

* Can act as a mix of damage and survivability as a **Geo** pairing. Same pairing benefits as other **Geo **characters.
* Traveler (Geo) can act as an Energy Battery to recharge Noelle's **Elemental Burst**.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)

* Bennett's **Elemental Burst **provides healing and a massive **Attack **buff, making him a recommended character in most teams.

* Characters with strong Off-Field damage can be easily utilized in **Geo**-focused teams, which Traveler (Geo) typically appear in.

## Does Not Work Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Cryo.webp)

* **Geo** damage shatters **Freeze**, disrupting** Freeze**-based teams.
* Many **Cryo** characters would prefer to utilize the powerful reactions they have access to rather than the pure damage that many **Geo** teams tend towards.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Anemo.webp)

* **Geo** cannot take advantage of **Viridescent Venerer**'s effect. **Anemo** does not provide anything for Traveler (Geo)** **aside from Crowd Control.

* Focuses on raw **Pyro** damage with Klee. Traveler (Geo) and Zhongli provide **Geo Resonance **along with Off-Field damage from Zhongli’s **Elemental Skill** and its resonance with the **Geo Constructs** the two characters create.
* Bennett acts as a healer and buffer and activates **Pyro Resonance **with Klee for more **Attack**.

* A team that uses Ningguang as the Main DPS with Traveler (Geo) acting as another source of **Energy Particles **and an activator of** Geo Resonance**. Traveler (Geo) is used in quick windows, deploying their **Elemental Skill** for energy and their **Elemental Burst** for buffs to other party members.
