# Traveler (Geo)

## Roles

* **Burst DPS**
* **Support:** Buffer (Constellation 1)
* **Main DPS**

## Character Breakdown

* Elemental Skill summons a meteor from the ground that deals Geo damage. The meteorite is considered as a Geo Construct
* Elemental Skill has a maximum of 3 meteorites that can exist at the same time before the earliest summon is destroyed.
  * Holding Elemental Skill lets you control where to summon the meteor.
  * With Constellation 2, meteorites deal damage when destroyed.
* Elemental Burst creates shockwaves that deal Geo damage and erect a barrier at the edge of the shockwaves. The barrier is considered a Geo construct.
  * Constellation 1 increases Crit Rate and resistance to interruptions of the characters inside the radius of the barrier.
  * Constellation 4 causes the Traveler (Geo) to recover 5 energy for every enemy hit by their Elemental Burst. A maximum of 25 energy can be recovered.

## Additional Notes

* Often paired with another Geo character to both provide energy to them and also to gain increased energy to maintain Elemental Burst uptime. This pairing also causes Geo Resonance, greatly increasing the damage of both users.
* C6 increases the duration of the summoned meteorite by 10 seconds and the barrier created by their Elemental burst for an additional 5 seconds.

## Works Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Zhongli.png)

* Traveler (Geo) is almost always paired with Zhongli to have their Geo constructs resonate with Zhongli’s Elemental Skill's stone stele dealing additional damage. Enables Geo Resonance to further increase the damage done. Traveler (Geo) also acts can also act as an energy battery for Zhongli since they can produce consistent energy particles with their Elemental skill.

* An alternative to Zhongli, Ningguang offers a more DPS focused kit. Similarly to Zhongli, enables Geo Resonance and the two characters can provide each other with energy.

* Can act as a mix of damage and survivability as a Geo pairing. Same pairing benefits as other Geo characters.
* Can act as an Energy Battery to fund Noelle's Elemental Burst.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)

* As with all other characters, Bennet can provide large increases to Traveler (Geo)'s damage and teamwide healing.

* Characters with strong Off-Field damage can be easily utilized in Geo focused teams, which Traveler (Geo) typically appears in.

## Does Not Work Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Cryo.webp)

* Geo damage shatters Freeze, disrupting Freeze based teams.
* Many Cryo characters would prefer to utilize the powerful reactions they have access to rather than the pure damage that many Geo teams tend towards.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Anemo.webp)

* Anemo cannot trigger reactions with Geo, both reducing the damage potential of the element and preventing the characters from being able to activate the powerful Viridescent Venerer artifact set.
  * Venti and Kazuha can be exceptions due to their crowd control and the amount of damage they can deal if properly built.

* Focuses on raw Pyro damage with Klee. Traveler (Geo) and Zhongli provide Geo Resonance along with Off-Field damage from Zhongli’s Elemental Skill and it's resonance with the Geo constructs the two characters create.
* Bennett acts as as a healer and buffer and activates Pyro Resonance with Klee for more attack.

* A team that uses Ningguang as the Main DPS with Traveler (Geo) to act as another source of energy particles and activate Geo Resonance. Traveler (Geo) is used in quick windows, deploying their Elemental Skill for energy and their Elemental Burst for buffs to other party members.
