# Traveler (Geo)

## Roles

* **Burst DPS**
* **Support:** Buffer (C1)
* **Main DPS**

## Character Breakdown

* **Elemental Skill** **(Tap)** summons a meteorite from the ground that deals **Geo** damage. The meteorite is a **Geo** construct.
  * A maximum of 3 **Geo** constructs can exist at the same time before the earliest summon is destroyed.
    * **Elemental Skill (Hold)** lets you control where to summon the meteorite.
    * **C2** causes meteorites to deal damage when destroyed.
* **Elemental Burst** creates shockwaves that deal **Geo** damage and erects a barrier at the edge of the shockwaves. The barrier is considered a **Geo** **Construct**.
  * **C1** increases **CRIT Rate** and resistance to interruptions of the characters inside the radius of the barrier.
  * **C4** causes the Traveler (**Geo**) to recover 5 Energy for every enemy hit by their **Elemental Burst**. A maximum of 25 energy can be recovered.

## Additional Notes

* Often paired with another **Geo** character to both provide energy to them and also to gain increased energy to maintain **Elemental Burst** uptime. This pairing also causes **Geo Resonance**, greatly increasing the damage of both users.
* **C6** increases the duration of the summoned meteorite by 10 seconds and the barrier created by their **Elemental Burst** for an additional 5 seconds.

## Works Well With

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Geo.webp)

* Traveler (**Geo**) is almost always paired with a 2nd **Geo** character to activate **Geo Resonance** to further increase the **Geo** Damage dealt to enemies.
* Zhongli allows **Geo** constructs to resonate with the **Stone Stele** summoned by Zhongli’s **Elemental Skill** to additional damage. Traveler (**Geo**) also acts as an Energy Battery for Zhongli since they can consistently produce **Geo Energy Particles** with their **Elemental Skill**.

* Bennett's **Elemental Burst** provides healing and a massive **Attack** buff, making him a recommended character in most teams.

* Characters with strong Off-Field damage can be easily utilized in **Geo**-focused teams, which Traveler (**Geo**) typically appear in.

## Does Not Work Well With

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Cryo.webp)

* **Geo** damage triggers the **Shatter** reaction stopping enemies from being **Frozen**, which results in disrupting **Freeze**-based teams.
* Many **Cryo** characters would prefer to utilize the powerful reactions they have access to rather than the pure damage that many **Geo** teams tend to focus towards.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Anemo.webp)

* **Geo** cannot take advantage of **Viridescent Venerer** 4-set effect. **Anemo** does not provide anything for Traveler (**Geo**) aside from Crowd Control.

* A team that uses Ningguang as the Main DPS with Traveler (**Geo**) acting as another source of **Energy Particles** and activates **Geo Resonance**. Traveler (**Geo**) is used in quick windows, deploying their **Elemental Skill** for **Energy Particle** generation and their **Elemental Burst** to provide buffs to other party members.

* Focuses on raw **Pyro** damage with Klee. Traveler (Geo) and Zhongli provide **Geo Resonance** along with Off-Field damage from Zhongli’s **Stone Seele** and its pulses with the **Geo** constructs the two characters create.
* Bennett acts as a healer and buffer and activates **Pyro Resonance** with Klee for extra **Attack**.
