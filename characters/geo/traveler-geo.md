# Traveler \(Geo\)

## Roles

* Main DPS 
* Sub DPS

## Character Breakdown

* Elemental skill summons a meteor from the ground that deals geo damage. The meteorite is considered as Geo Construct
* Elemental skill have a maximum of 3 meteorites that can exist at the same time before the earliest summon is destroyed.
  * Holding Elemental skill lets you control where to summon the meteor.
  * With constellation 2, meteorites deal damage when destroyed.
* Elemental Burst creates shockwaves that deal geo damage and erect a barrier at the edge of the shockwaves. The barrier is considered as Geo construct
  * Constellation 1 increases crit rate and resistance to interruptions of the characters inside the radius of the barrier.
  * Constellation 4 lets the Traveler \(Geo\) recover 5 energy for every enemy hit by their Elemental burst. A maximum of 25 energy can be recovered.

## Additional Notes

*  Often paired with another geo character  to help battery them and also to get regenerate energy for themselves to help Elemental burst uptime. Also enable geo resonance that offers damage boost.
* Constellation 6 increases the duration of the summoned meteorite by 10 seconds and the barrier created by their Elemental burst for an additional 5 seconds.

## Works Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_zhongli.png) 

* Traveler \(Geo\) is almost always paired with Zhongli to have their geo constructs resonate with Zhongli’s stone stele dealing additional damage. Enables Geo resonance to further increase the damage done. Traveler \(Geo\) also acts as the battery for Zhongli since they can produce consistent energy particles with their Elemental skill.

* An alternative to Zhongli, Ningguang’s offer a more burst damage focus kit and also help each other to fuel their Elemental Burst.

* Acts as the healer and shield provider for Traveler \(Geo\), also enables geo resonances with them. 

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_bennett.png) 

* Bennett basically works with everything under the sun. He provides buffing and healing.

* Provide off field damage and albedo activate Geo resonance which is beneficial.

## Does Not Work Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/element_cryo.webp) 

* Traveler \(Geo\) shatters frozen enemies due to their geo damage focus kit.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/element_anemo.webp) 

* Traveler \(Geo\) can’t benefit from Viridescent Venerer. Geo can’t react with Anemo and Current Anemo characters doesn't offer something other characters can give.
  * Venti and kazuha can be an exceptions due to their CC and the amount of damage they can deal if properly built.

MAIN DPS

[Geo](../../teams/geo.md)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_aether_geo.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_zhongli.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_ningguang.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_bennett.png) 

* A typical Geo team composition where Traveler summon geo constructs using their Elemental skill and burst to deal damage, Zhongli stone stele will cause additional damage by resonating with nearby geo constructs and his debuffs will further increase damage dealt. Ningguang helps battery Traveler \(Geo\), Zhongli and herself while also providing burst damage windows and buffs geo damage from her passive talent. 
* Bennett provides buffing and healing.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_aether_geo.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_zhongli.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_albedo.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_bennett.png) 

* Almost the exact team above but with albedo replacing ningguang. This focuses on  sustain damage instances.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_aether_geo.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_zhongli.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_fischl.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_beidou.png) 

* A team that doesn't include a healer for more damage instances from beidou and fishcl. Zhongli’s shield and Beidou’s damage reduction from her Elemental burst can reduce the need for a healer. 
* Fischl serves as another source of off field damage and helps fuel both her and Beidou’s Elemental burst.

SUB DPS

[Pyro](../../teams/pure-pyro.md)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_klee.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_aether_geo.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_zhongli.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_bennett.png) 

* Focuses on raw damage with Klee. Traveler \(Geo\) and Zhongli provide geo resonances along with the off field damage Zhongli’s stele can inflict with the help of Traveler’s \(Geo\) geo constructs. Bennett acts as the healer, buffer and activates pyro resonance with klee for more attack.

[Geo](../../teams/geo.md)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_ningguang.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_aether_geo.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_xiangling.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_bennett.png) 

* A generally used team that used Ningguang as the main DPS with Traveler \(Geo\) to act as another source of energy particles and activate geo resonances. Traveler \(Geo\) will act as quick inbetween for a quick use of their Elemental skill and burst
