## Teams

{% hint style="info" %}
We have not included every single team here as some Geo characters can be used on virtually all team compositions. Zhongli in particular is often used in every team if possible due to his incredibly strong Burst Damage, Debuffing & Shielding capabilities.\
\
Geo characters do not contribute to any Elemental Reactions required for team compositions.

{% hint style="info" %}
Geo Resonance can provide a significant boost to team DPS but can often compete for space on the team.
