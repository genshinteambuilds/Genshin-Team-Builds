# Itto

## **Roles**

* **Main DPS**

## **Character Breakdown**

* 2nd and 4th consecutive **Normal Attack** that hit opponents grant Itto 1 or 2 stacks of Superlative Superstrength, respectively.
  * Superlative Strength: Max 5 stacks. Each new stack refreshes the current duration of any existing stacks.
* **Charged Attack** is unique and performs a series of Arataki Kesagiri slashes without consuming Stamina when held. Each Arataki Kesagiri slash consumes 1 stack of Superlative Superstrength. When the final stack is consumed, Itto delivers a powerful final slash. If no stacks of Superlative Superstrength are available, Itto will perform a single Saichimonji Slash.
* **Elemental Skill** throws Ushi (Geo Construct) and deals AoE damage to enemies hit. Itto gains 1 stack of Superlative Strength if enemies are hit.
  * Ushi taunts enemies and gives Itto a stack of Superlative Strength when hit.
* **A1** grants Itto increased resistance to interruption and **ATK SPD** during consecutive Arataki Kesagiri slashes.
* **A4** increases Arataki Kesagiri **DMG** by a percentage of his **DEF**.
* **Elemental Burst** infuses Itto's weapon with **Geo** and provides an **ATK** buff that scales off of his **DEF**. Itto also loses **Elemental** and **Physical Resistance** during this time.

## **Additional Notes**

* Itto is often paired with other **Geo** characters to battery him provide **Geo Resonance**.
* Itto plays around building up his Superlative Strength stacks and using them consecutively through **Charged Attacks** during his **Elemental Burst**.
* **C1** builds up Superlative Strength stacks after casting **Elemental Burst**, reducing the need to pre-stack.
* **C2** reduces **Elemental Burst** cooldown as well as restores Energy based on the amount of **Geo** characters in the party.
* **C6** greatly increases Arataki Kesagiri slash **CRIT DMG**. Arataki Slashes have a chance to not consume a Superlative Strength stack.

## Works Well With

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Gorou.png)

* Gorou is made to support **DEF** scaling characters like Itto. He provides a **DEF** buff as well as multiple other small buffs to the party with no downtime as well as greatly increasing Geo **CRIT DMG** at **C6**.
* Can provide chip healing at **C4**.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Zhongli.png)

* Zhongli's shield gives Itto the the safety to focus on dealing damage uninterrupted.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Geo.webp)

* Almost all **Geo** characters can work well Itto as long as they are able to provide offensive buffs, energy for Itto, or complete **Geo Resonance**.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)

* Bennett provides Itto with a large **ATK** buff and healing, making him a valuable teammate to slot in as a healer. However, Bennett's flat **ATK** buff is often better used on other characters as Itto will have higher total **ATK** than average Main DPS characters due to his **DEF** to **ATK** conversion.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Albedo.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Fischl.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Diona.png)

* Albedo and Fischl provide strong off-field damage and are able to battery the team. Diona can provide both a shield and healing. Both Fischl and Diona can provide an element for **Crystallize** to occur.

## Does Not Work Well With

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Noelle.png)

* Noelle is a unit that wants to be on-field and Itto will take majority of the field time in any team he is on. She doesn't provide a strong enough shield and it has high downtime, making her a poor **Geo** character to pair with Itto.

* As a Selfish Main DPS, Itto does not work well with other characters that must stay on the field in order to do damage.

* Gorou is Itto's primary offensive buffer, providing **DEF** as well as various other offensive and defensive buffs.
* Albedo benefits greatly from Gorou as well and is able to provide strong off-field damage.
* Zhongli provides the shield for **Geo Resonance** and survivability.
* This full Geo team is able to take advantage of multiple **Geo** constructs providing energy for Itto, making his **Energy Recharge** requirement lower.
