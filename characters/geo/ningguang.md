# Ningguang

## Roles

* **Main DPS**
* **Burst DPS**
* **Support:** Energy Battery

## Character Breakdown:

* **Normal Attack** fires a homing **Geo** projectile.
* **Normal Attacks** that hit an enemy will grant Ningguang one **Star Jade**. A maximum of three **Star Jades** stacks can be held at once.
* When Ningguang performs a **Charged Attack**, all **Star Jades** will be released and target opponents.
  * When Ninguang has a **Star Jade**, her **Charged Attacks** will not consume **Stamina.**
* **Elemental Skill** summons a **Jade Screen** that does damage upon summon and remains on the field to block out projectiles. This will count as a **Geo** construct.
* **Elemental Burst** fires six homing projectiles at nearby enemies. If a **Jade Screen** is present, it is shattered into another six similar projectiles.

## Additional Note:

* Her damage contribution is mainly distributed across her **Charged Attacks**, **Elemental Skill**, and **Elemental Burst** casts.
* **C2** can reset her **Elemental Skill** cooldown if the **Jade Screen** shatters under any circumstances, including from a recast of her **Elemental Skill**.
  * **Elemental Skill** has a six-second internal cooldown on **Energy Particle** generation. As such, there should generally be at least six seconds between every cast of her **Elemental Skill**.
* Ningguang has a very simple **Normal** and **Charged Attack** combo, as **Star Jades** are only given on hit, not upon performing a **Normal Attack**. This combo will consistently make her **charged attacks** cost no stamina.
  * `NA → NA → CA (Rinse and Repeat)`
  * where: `NA`  = **Normal Attack** `CA` = **Charged Attack**
  * **C2** will require Ningguang to perform a combo with her **Elemental Skill** and **Burst** and then her **Normal**/**Charged Attack** combo.
    * `E → Q → (NA → NA → CA for 6 seconds) → E → NA → NA → CA`
    * where: `E` = **Elemental Skill** `Q` = **Elemental Burst**
* Ningguang's **Normal Attack** animation can be cancelled, allowing her to perform them faster. This can be done by holding down on a walking direction while doing **Normal Attacks**.
* Ningguang doesn’t require **Elemental Reactions** to deal damage, making her an excellent choice for co-op (where reaction setups are hard to coordinate). However, this means that Ningguang cannot benefit from the various effects provided by **Elemental Reactions** to increase her damage.

## Works well with

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Zhongli.png)

* Zhongli is the most ideal pairing for Ningguang because of the **Geo Resonance** buff. His Shield is extremely durable and Debuffs nearby enemies' **Elemental Resistance**. Together, these two effects greatly increase Ningguang's damage.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Albedo.png)

* Albedo provides **Geo Energy Particles**, **Geo Resonance**, and Off-Field damage. His **Elemental Skill** cooldowns line up with Ningguang’s.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Aether\_Geo.png)

* Traveler (Geo) provides **Geo Energy Particles,** **Geo Resonance**, and a **CRIT Rate** buff**.** He also has cooldowns that line up with Ningguang's. However, he lacks Off-Field damage, forcing frequent character swaps.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)

* Bennett's **Elemental Burst** provides healing and a massive **ATK** buff, making him a recommended character in most teams.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xiangling.png)

* Xiangling enables **Pyro Resonance,** provides an **ATK** buff with her **A4,** and can deal high amounts of damage with her **Elemental Burst**.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Beidou.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Fischl.png)

* Fischl and Beidou provide extra Off-field damage and generate **Energy Particles** to recharge Ninnguang's **Elemental Burst** faster.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Venti.png)

* Venti is useful for Crowd Control and grouping small enemies together, which allows Ningguang to take advantage of her **C1**.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Mona.png)

* Mona provides taunt utility, an **ATK** buff (through the **Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers** catalyst), and her signature **Omen** debuff.

## Does not work well with

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)

* Xingqiu isn't necessarily bad with Ningguang (as any Off-Field DPS works with a **Geo** Team), but his potential is wasted as Ningguang’s attack sequence generally does not line up well with Xingqiu.
  * He is better used on teams where his utility and **Hydro** application greatly benefit other Main DPS characters.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Chongyun.png)

* Chongyun doesn’t provide anything else aside from damage through his **Elemental Burst**. Chongyun's **Elemental Skill** doesn't affect Catalyst Main DPS characters.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Anemo.webp)

* **Geo** cannot take advantage of **Viridescent Venerer** 4-set effect. **Anemo** does not provide anything for Ningguang aside from Crowd Control.

* Ningguang’s teams generally consist of 2 **Geo** characters to activate **Geo Resonance**, which is recommended because of **Geo**'s lack of damaging reactions.
* **Pyro Resonance** is used to buff **ATK**.
* Ningguang's attacks are ineffective against shields. As such, shield-breaking utility should be prioritized (if applicable) to maximize Ningguang's damage.
