# Ningguang

## Roles

* **Main DPS**
* **Burst DPS**
* **Support:** Energy Battery

## Character Breakdown:

* **Normal Attack** fires a homing **Geo** projectile.
* **Normal Attacks** that hit an enemy will grant Ningguang one **Star Jade**. A maximum of three **Star Jades** can be held at once.&#x20;
* When Ningguang performs a **Charged Attack**, all **Star Jades** will be released and target opponents.
  * When Ninnguang has a **Star Jade**, her **Charged Attacks** will not cost stamina.
* **Elemental Skill** summons a **Jade Screen** that does damage upon summon and remains on the field to block out projectiles.
* **Elemental Burst** fires six homing projectiles at nearby enemies. If a **Jade Screen** is present, it is shattered into another six similar projectiles.

## Additional Note:

* Her damage contribution is mainly distributed across her **Charge Attacks**, **Elemental Skill**, and **Elemental Burst** casts.
* **C2** can reset her **Elemental Skill** cooldown if the **Jade Screen** shatters under any circumstances, including from a recast of her **Elemental Skill**.
  * **Elemental Skill** has a six-second internal cooldown on **Energy Particle** generation. **** As such, there should generally be at least six seconds between every cast of her **Elemental Skill**.
* Ningguang has a very simple **Normal** and **Charged Attack** combo, as **Star Jades** are only given on hit, not upon performing a **Normal Attack**. This combo will consistently make her **charged attacks** cost no stamina.
  * N2 → CA (Rinse and Repeat)
    * N2  = 2 **Normal Attacks**
    * CA = **Charged Attack**
  * Ningguang's **Elemental Skill** and **Burst** are cast on cooldown while performing this attack combo. Make sure her **Jade Screen** is present when casting her **Elemental Burst** for higher damage.
    * **C2** will require Ningguang to perform a combo with her **Elemental Skill** and **Burst**.
      * **Elemental Skill** → **Elemental Burst** → Wait for six seconds → **Elemental Skill**
* Ningguang's **Normal Attack** be animation canceled, allowing her to perform them faster. This can be done by holding down on a walking direction while doing **Normal Attacks**.
* Ningguang doesn’t require **Elemental Reactions** to deal damage, making her an excellent choice for co-op (where reaction setups are hard to coordinate). However, this means that Ningguang cannot benefit from the various effects provided by **Elemental Reactions**.

## Works well with

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Zhongli.png)

* Zhongli is the most ideal pairing for Ningguang because of the **Geo Resonance** buff. His shield is extremely durable and debuffs nearby enemy **Elemental/Physical Resistance**. Together, these two effects greatly increase Ningguang's damage.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Albedo.png)

* Albedo provides **Geo Particles**, **Geo Resonance**, and Off-field damage. His **Elemental Skill** cooldowns line up with Ningguang’s.&#x20;

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Aether\_Geo.png)

* Geo MC provides **Geo Particles,** **Geo Resonance**, and a **Critical Rate** buff**.** He also has cooldowns that align with Ningguang's. However, he lacks Off-Field damage, forcing frequent character swaps.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)

* Bennett's **Elemental Burst** provides healing and a massive **Attack** buff, making him a recommended character in most teams.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xiangling.png)

* Xiangling enables **Pyro Resonance,** provides an **Attack** buff with her **A4,** and can deal high amounts of damage with her **Elemental Burst**.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Beidou.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Fischl.png)

* Fischl and Beidou provide extra Off-field damage and generate **Energy Particles** to recharge Ninnguang's **Elemental Burst** faster.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Venti.png)

* Venti is useful for Crowd Control and grouping small enemies together, which allows Ningguang to take advantage of her **C1**.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Mona.png)

* Mona provides taunt utility, an **Attack** buff (through the Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers catalyst), and **** her signature **Omen** debuff.

## Does not work well with

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)

* Xingqiu isn't necessarily bad with Ningguang (as any Off-field DPS works with a **Geo** Team), but his potential is wasted as Ningguang’s attack sequence generally does not line up well with Xingqiu.
  * He is better used on teams where his utility and **Hydro** application greatly benefit other Main DPS characters.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Chongyun.png)

* Chongyun doesn’t provide anything else aside from **Elemental Burst** damage. Chongyun's **Elemental Skill** doesn't affect Catalyst Main DPS characters.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Anemo.webp)

* **Geo** cannot take advantage of **Viridescent Venerer**'s effect. **Anemo** does not provide anything for Ningguang **** aside from Crowd Control.

* Ningguang’s teams generally consist of 2 **Geo** characters to activate **Geo Resonance**, which is recommended because of **Geo**'s lack of damaging reactions**.**&#x20;
* **Pyro Resonance** is highly recommended.
* Ningguang's attacks are ineffective against shields. As such, shield-breaking utility should be prioritized (if applicable) to maximize Ningguang's damage.
