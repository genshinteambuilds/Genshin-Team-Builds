# Albedo

## y**Roles**

* **Off-Field DPS** (Elemental Skill)
* **Burst DPS**
* **Support**: Buffer (A4, C4, C6)

## **Character Breakdown**

* **Elemental Skill** creates a **Geo** **Construct** that deals **Geo** damage in an area upon skill activation and creates a field.
  * While inside this field, whenever an enemy takes damage, an additional instance of **Geo** damage will also be dealt, with a short cooldown.&#x20;
    * **A1** allows his **Elemental Skill** to deal increased damage to enemies under 50% **HP**.
  * The **Geo** **Construct** itself acts as an elevator.
* **Elemental Burst** deals **Geo** damage in a frontal area.
  * If Albedo's **Elemental Burst** is cast within the field created by his **Elemental Skill**, it will do 7 more instances of **Geo** damage towards enemies in the field.
    * Damage dealt this way will not activate his **Elemental Skill**'s effects.
* **A4** buffs all members of the party's **Elemental Mastery** after activating his **Elemental Burst**.

## **Additional Notes**

* His passive talent has a 10% chance to double the product when Albedo crafts weapon ascension materials.
* **C4** buffs **Plunging Attack** damage when the active character is standing within the field created by Albedo's **Elemental Skill**.
* **C6** buffs the damage of the active character by 17% when protected by a shield created by **Crystallize** and inside of the field created by his **Elemental Skill**.

* Albedo works well with most of the characters in the game. His **Elemental Skill** is very easy to activate and does considerable amounts of damage.
* The **Elemental Mastery** buff from Albedo's **A4** passive allows him to be run in teams that are focused around **Elemental Reactions**.
* Can be used as an activator for **Geo Resonance**.

## **Does Not Work Well With**

* Since Albedo does **Geo** damage with his whole kit, he shatters **Frozen** enemies. This makes him detrimental to **Freeze** team compositions.
