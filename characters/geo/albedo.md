# Albedo

## **Roles**

* **Sub DPS** \(Off Field, Burst\)
* **Support:** Buffer

## **Character Breakdown**

* Elemental Skill \(Abiogenesis: Solar Isotoma\) creates a geo construct that deals AoE geo damage upon skill activation and creates a wide Solar Isotoma field. While inside the Solar Isotoma Field, when an enemy takes damage, it will trigger the Solar Isotoma to create Transient Blossoms to the enemy which deals AoE geo damage.
* Elemental Burst \(Rite of Progeniture: Tectonic Tide\) upon activation, deals AoE geo damage in front of him. If Albedo activated his Burst inside his Solar Isotoma Field, it does 7 more instances of AoE geo damage around the field called Fatal Blossoms. 

## **Additional Notes**

* His 1st Ascension Talent, Calcite Might, deals more transient blossom damage to enemies with less than 50% HP
* His 4th Ascension talent, Homuncular Nature, when Albedo uses his Elemental Burst, the Elemental Mastery of everyone in the party is increased by 125 for 10 seconds.
* His burst \(Tectonic Tide and Fatal Blossoms\) will not generate and activate Transient Blossoms.
* His passive talent \(Flash of Genius\) has a 10% chance to receive double product when albedo crafts weapon ascension materials.
* Buffs Plunging Damage at C4 when the active character is standing within the field created by Albedo's Elemental Skill.
* Buffs Damage % at C6 when protected by a shield created by Crystallize.

## **Works Well With**

* Albedo works well with most of the characters in the game. His Elemental Skill can serve as a turret where you just activate it, then swap to another team in the party and make him deal a lot of damage off field.
* With his Elemental Burst’s Elemental Mastery Buff, he could work with reaction teams like vaporize or melt.
* He works best as the 2nd Geo character in the party that would provide Geo Resonance that increases shield strength and increases damage dealt by characters that are shielded.

## **Does Not Work Well With**

* Since Albedo does geo damage with his whole kit, he would shatter frozen enemies, thus making him not beneficial to any freeze team compositions.
