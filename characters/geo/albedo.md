# Albedo

## **Roles**

* **Sub DPS** \(Off Field, Burst\)
* **Support:** Buffer

## **Character Breakdown**

* Elemental Skill creates a geo construct that deals AoE Geo damage upon skill activation and creates a field. 
  * While inside this field, whenever an enemy takes damage, an instance of AoE Geo damage will also be dealt periodically.
    * At A1, AoE Geo damage generated this way will deal increased damage to enemies under 50% HP.
* Elemental Burst deals AoE Geo damage in a frontal area. 
  * If Albedo's Elemental Burst is cast within the field created by his Elemental Skill, it will do 7 more instances of AoE Geo damage around the field. 
    * Damage dealt this way will not activate his Elemental Skill's effects.
* At A4, buffs Elemental Mastery after activating his Elemental Burst

## **Additional Notes**

* His passive talent has a 10% chance to receive double product when albedo crafts weapon ascension materials.
* At C4, buffs plunging damage when the active character is standing within the field created by Albedo's Elemental Skill.
* At C6, buffs the Damage % of the active character when protected by a shield created by Crystallize and inside of the field created by his Elemental Skill.

* Albedo works well with most of the characters in the game. His Elemental Skill is very easy to activate and does considerable amounts of damage.
* The Elemental Mastery buff from Albedo's A4 passive allows him to be run in teams that utilize Vaporize or Melt.
* Can be used as an activator for Geo Resonance.

* Since Albedo does Geo damage with his whole kit, he would shatter frozen enemies, thus making him detrimental to freeze team compositions.
