# Albedo

## **Roles**

* **Off-Field DPS** (Elemental Skill)
* **Burst DPS**
* \*\*Support: \*\*Buffer (A4, C4, C6)

## **Character Breakdown**

* Elemental Skill creates a Geo construct that deals AoE Geo damage upon skill activation and creates a field.
  * While inside this field, whenever an enemy takes damage, an instance of AoE Geo damage will also be dealt periodically.
    * At A1, AoE Geo damage generated this way will deal increased damage to enemies under 50% HP.
  * The construct itself acts as an elevator.
* Elemental Burst deals AoE Geo damage in a frontal area.
  * If Albedo's Elemental Burst is cast within the field created by his Elemental Skill, it will do 7 more instances of AoE Geo damage around the field.
    * Damage dealt this way will not activate his Elemental Skill's effects.
* At A4, buffs all members of the party's Elemental Mastery after activating his Elemental Burst.

## **Additional Notes**

* His passive talent has a 10% chance to receive double product when Albedo crafts weapon ascension materials.
* At C4, buffs Plunging Attack damage when the active character is standing within the field created by Albedo's Elemental Skill.
* At C6, buffs the damage of the active character by 17% when protected by a shield created by Crystallize and inside of the field created by his Elemental Skill.

* Albedo works well with most of the characters in the game. His Elemental Skill is very easy to activate and does considerable amounts of damage.
* The Elemental Mastery buff from Albedo's A4 passive allows him to be run in teams that utilize Vaporize or Melt.
* Can be used as an activator for Geo Resonance.

## **Does Not Work Well With**

* Since Albedo does Geo damage with his whole kit, he shatters frozen enemies. This makes him detrimental to Freeze team compositions.
