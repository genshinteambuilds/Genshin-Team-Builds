# Noelle

## **Roles**

* **Support:** Healer, Shielder
* **Main DPS**

## **Character Breakdown**

* **Elemental Skill** is a shield that deals **Geo** **DMG** when cast.
  * **Elemental Skill** does not generate **Energy Particles**.
  * The shield's damage absorption scales on Noelle's **DEF**.
* **A1** creates a shield when any character in the party falls below 30% **HP**. This has a cooldown of 60 seconds.
* **A4** reduces the cooldown of her **Elemental Skill** by 1 second for every 4 **Normal** or **Charged Attacks** that hit enemies. Hitting multiple enemies with one attack will only count as one hit.
* **Elemental Burst** deals **Geo** **DMG** in a wide area. Noelle gains the following effects:
  * Attack range greatly increased.
  * Converts Noelle's **Normal Attack** and **Charged Attack** **DMG** into into **Geo** which cannot be overridden.
  * Gains an **ATK** buff that scales off of her **DEF**.

## **Additional Notes**

* Noelle can function as a Main DPS or a Support who provides healing, shielding, and possibly **Geo Resonance**.
* A Main DPS Noelle should be played with **Geo Resonance** for a **DMG Bonus** buff when shielded, and a **Geo RES** debuff against enemies. She also requires a **Geo** Energy Battery in order to reach 100% uptime on her **Elemental Burst**. It is not recommended to use her as a Main DPS before **C6**.
  * Noelle's inability to heal Off-Field weakens her functionality as a Support, especially when compared to other Supports. As such, she should generally be used as the Main DPS in most teams she is run on.
* **C4** allows Noelle's shield to deal **AoE** **Geo** **DMG** when it expires or gets destroyed.
* **C6** Increases the **ATK** buff she receives when casting her **Elemental Burst**.
* Noelleâ€™s **Geo** infusion from her **Elemental Burst** persists when she is swapped out, allowing players to rotate through the rest of the team during its duration.

## **Works Well With**

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Geo.webp)

* All current **Geo** characters are solid choices to add to a Noelle team, both for **Geo Resonance** and for their individual supporting or damaging capabilities.

* Bennett's **Elemental Burst** provides healing and a massive **ATK** buff, making him a recommended character in most teams.
  * His **C6** cannot override Noelle's **Geo** infusion during her **Elemental Burst**.

* Characters with strong Off-Field **DMG** can be easily utilized in **Geo** focused teams. Noelle doesn't need **Elemental Reactions** to deal damage as a **Geo** character.

* Boosts Noelle's **Normal Attack** **DMG**.

## **Does Not Work Well With**

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Anemo.webp)

* **Geo** cannot take advantage of **Viridescent Venerer** 4-set effect.. **Anemo** does not provide anything for Noelle aside from Crowd Control.

## **Teams**

{% hint style="warning" %}

* Noelle serves as the Main DPS in this team. She takes advantage of both **Geo** and **Pyro** **Resonance** to increase her damage.
  * Bennett provides an **ATK** buff with his **Elemental Burst**.
  * Traveler (Geo) acts as an Energy Battery for Noelle and can buff her **CRIT Rate** with his **C1**.
