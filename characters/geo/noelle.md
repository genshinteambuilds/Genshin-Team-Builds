# Noelle

## **Roles**

* **Support:** Healer, Shielder
* **Main DPS**

## **Character Breakdown**

* **Elemental Skill** is a high cooldown shield that deals **Geo** damage when cast.
  * **Elemental Skill **does not generate **Energy Particles**.
* **A1** creates a shield when any character in the party falls below 30% **HP**. This has a cooldown of 60 seconds.
* **A4** reduces the cooldown of her **Elemental Skill **by 1 second for every 4 **Normal **or** Charged Attacks **that hit enemies. Hitting multiple enemies with one attack will only count as one hit.
* **Elemental Burst** deals **Geo** damage in a wide area. Noelle gains the following effects:
  * Attack range greatly increased.
  * Gains a **Geo** infusion which cannot be overridden.
  * Gains an **Attack **buff that scales off of her** Defense**.

## **Additional Notes**

* Noelle can function as a Main DPS or a Support who provides healing, shielding, and possibly **Geo Resonance**.
* A Main DPS Noelle should be played with **Geo Resonance** for a damage buff when shielded, and a **Geo Resistance** debuff. She also requires a **Geo** Energy Battery in order to reach 100% uptime on her **Elemental Burst**. It is not recommended to use her as a Main DPS before **C6**.
  * Noelle's inability to heal Off-Field weakens her functionality as a Support, especially when compared to other Supports. As such, she should generally be used as the Main DPS in most teams she is run on.
* **C4** allows Noelle's shield to deal AoE **Geo** Damage when it expires or gets destroyed.
* **C6 **Increases the **Attack** buff she receives when casting her **Elemental Burst**.
* Noelleâ€™s **Geo** infusion from her **Elemental Burst** persists when she is swapped out, allowing players to rotate through the rest of the team during its duration.

## **Works Well With**

****![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Geo.webp)****

* All current **Geo** characters are solid choices to add to a Noelle team, both for **Geo Resonance** and for their individual supporting or damaging capabilities.

* Bennett's **Elemental Burst** provides healing and a massive **Attack** buff, making him a recommended character in most teams.
  * His** C6** cannot override Noelle's **Geo** infusion during her **Elemental Burst**.

* Characters with strong Off-Field damage can be easily utilized in **Geo** focused teams. Noelle doesn't need **Elemental Reactions **to deal damage as a** Geo** character.

## **Does Not Work Well With**

****![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Anemo.webp)****

* **Geo** cannot take advantage of **Viridescent Venerer**'s effect. **Anemo** does not provide anything for Noelle** **aside from Crowd Control.

## **Teams**

{% hint style="warning" %}
This character is a healer. While some teams are provided below where they are particularly useful, this character can be used on any team provided you do not have better healing options.

* Noelle serves as the Main DPS in this team. She takes advantage of both** Geo** and **Pyro** **Resonance** to increase her damage.
  * Bennett provides an **Attack** buff with his **Elemental Burst**.
  * Geo Traveler acts as an Energy Battery for Noelle and can buff her **Critical Rate** with his **C1**.
