# Noelle

## **Roles**

* **Support:** Healer, Shielder
* **Main DPS**

## **Character Breakdown**

* Noelle can function as a Main DPS (ideally at Constellation 6) or a Support who provides healing, shielding, and possibly Geo Resonance.
* Elemental Skill is a high cooldown shield that deals Geo damage when cast and when broken.
  * Elemental Skill does not generate particles.
  * The shield will automatically break after its duration is reached.
* Elemental Burst deals Geo damage in a wide area. Noelle gains the following effects:
  * Attack range greatly increased.
  * Gains a Geo infusion which cannot be overridden.
  * Gains an Attack buff that scales off of her Defense.

## **Additional Notes**

* A Main DPS Noelle should be played with both Geo Resonance and a Geo Energy Battery in order to reach 100% uptime on her Elemental Burst. It is not recommended to use her as a Main DPS before Constellation 6.
  * Noelle's inability to heal Off-Field weakens her functionality as a Support, especially when compared to other Supports. As such, she should generally be used as the Main DPS in most teams she is run on.
* Noelle’s Geo infusion from her Elemental Burst persists when she is swapped out, allowing players to rotate through the rest of the team during its duration.

## **Works Well With**

* All current Geo characters are solid choices to add to a Noelle team, both for Geo resonance and for their individual supporting or damaging capabilities.

* Bennett can greatly buff Noelle's Attack. His Constellation 6 can’t override Noelle’s Geo infusion either.

* Any Off-Field Sub DPS can be added to a Noelle team.
  * Sub DPS that have high energy requirements should be run with a corresponding Energy Battery.

## **Does Not Work Well With**

* Noelle cannot take advantage of Viridescent Venerer's effect nor provide any unique offensive utility to other Anemo characters.
