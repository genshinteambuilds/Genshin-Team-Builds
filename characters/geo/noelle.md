# Noelle

## **Roles**

* **Main DPS**
* **Support** \(shield, off healer\)

## **Character Breakdown**

* Noelle can function as a Main DPS \(ideally at Constellation 6\) or a Support \(weak healing/shield or used for Geo Resonance\).
* Elemental Skill is a high cooldown shield that deals Geo dmg when cast and when broken or the duration is over. 
  * Elemental Skill does not generate particles.
* Elemental Burst deals Geo damage in a wide AoE. Noelle gains the following effects:
  * Attack range greatly increased.
  * Gains a Geo infusion which cannot be overridden.
  * Gains an ATK bonus that scales off her DEF.

## **Additional Notes**

* A Main DPS Noelle should be played with both Geo resonance and a Geo Energy Battery in order to reach 100% uptime on her Elemental Burst. It is not recommended to use her as a Main DPS before Constellation 6.
  * Noelle's inability to heal Off-Field weakens her functionality as a Support, espicially when compared to other Supports. As such, she should generally be used as the Main DPS in most teams.
* Noelle’s Geo infusion from her Elemental Burst persists when she is swapped out, allowing players to rotate through the rest of the team during its duration.

## **Works Well With**

* All current Geo characters are solid choices to add to a Noelle team, both for Geo resonance and for their individual supporting or damaging capabilities.

* Bennett is the best offensive support in the game, providing huge amounts of ATK for Noelle. His C6 can’t override Noelle’s geo infusion either.

* Any off field damage support is viable to add to a Noelle team. Keep in mind the energy costs/regen of these units though.

## **Does Not Work Well With**

* Noelle cannot take advantage of Viridescent Venerer nor do any of the current Anemo characters synergize or provide her with something that other elements can't. 

## **Teams**

**Main DPS Comp**

[Geo](../../teams/geo.md) 

3 geo + fill

* Zhong \(shield\) and Ning \(battery\) provide immense utility and can provide great damage as well with good ratios on their burst. Albedo is a decent alternative to any of the geo chars above 
* Bennett provides healing and huge offensive buffs.  

2 geo 2 pyro

* Takes advantage of the good geo and pyro resonance but can have energy issues for Noelle and Xiangling.

* A couple examples of a double geo team with 2 fill. Can choose any as long it fills the general needs of a team \(healing, enough energy regen for rotations off cooldown\).

**Support**

[![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_noelle.png)](noelle.md)

* If using Noelle as support, its probably due to limited resources and she is cheap to use as a support. She can be placed into any team that needs a healer and function as a pseudo healer. Not recommended but is an option early and if there is literally no one else to use.
