# Noelle

## **Roles**

* **Support:** Healer, Shielder
* **Main DPS**

## **Character Breakdown**

* Noelle can function as a Main DPS (ideally at Constellation 6) or a Support (weak healing/shield or used for Geo Resonance).
* Elemental Skill is a high cooldown shield that deals Geo damage when cast and when broken or when its duration is reached.
  * Elemental Skill does not generate particles.
* Elemental Burst deals Geo damage in a wide area. Noelle gains the following effects:
  * Attack range greatly increased.
  * Gains a Geo infusion which cannot be overridden.
  * Gains an attack buff that scales off of her defense stat.

## **Additional Notes**

* A Main DPS Noelle should be played with both Geo resonance and a Geo Energy Battery in order to reach 100% uptime on her Elemental Burst. It is not recommended to use her as a Main DPS before Constellation 6.
  * Noelle's inability to heal Off-Field weakens her functionality as a Support, especially when compared to other Supports. As such, she should generally be used as the Main DPS in most teams she is run on.
* Noelle’s Geo infusion from her Elemental Burst persists when she is swapped out, allowing players to rotate through the rest of the team during its duration.

## **Works Well With**

* All current Geo characters are solid choices to add to a Noelle team, both for Geo resonance and for their individual supporting or damaging capabilities.

* Bennett is the best offensive support in the game, providing huge amounts of ATK for Noelle. His C6 can’t override Noelle’s Geo infusion either.

* Any off field damage support is viable to add to a Noelle team. Keep in mind the energy costs and recharge rate of these units though.

## **Does Not Work Well With**

* Noelle cannot take advantage of Viridescent Venerer nor do any of the current Anemo characters synergise with her or provide her with something that other elements can't.

## **Teams**

**Main DPS Comp**

[Geo](../../teams/geo.md)

3 Geo + Support

* Zhong (shield) and Ning (battery) provide immense utility and can provide great damage as well with good ratios on their burst. Albedo is a decent alternative to any of the Geo chars above
* Bennett provides healing and huge offensive buffs.

2 Geo + 2 Pyro

* This team takes advantage of the good Geo and Pyro resonance but can result in some difficulty maintaining burst uptime on Noelle and Xiangling.

2 Geo

* A couple examples of a double Geo team with 2 supporting characters. Can choose any as long it fills the general needs of a team (healing, enough energy regen for rotations off cooldown).

**Support**

[![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI_AvatarIcon_Noelle.png)](noelle.md)

* If using Noelle as support, its probably due to limited resources and she is cheap to use as a support. She can be placed into any team that needs a healer and function as a pseudo healer. Not recommended but it is an option early on when there are not many characters available.
