# Zhongli

## **Roles**

* **Support**: Shielder, Debuffer, Crowd Control (Immobilization), Healer (C6)
* **Burst DPS**

## **Character Breakdown**

* **Elemental Skill (Tap)** has a short base cooldown and summons a **Stone Stele** which counts as a **Geo Construct**.
  * The **Stone Stele** pulses in short intervals dealing **Geo DMG**.
* **Elemental Skill (Hold)** will also summon a **Stone Stele** if the maximum amount of **Stone Steles** has not been reached, and provides a Jade Shield based on Zhongli's **Max** **HP**.
* **A1** allows his Jade Shield to fortify, increasing the **Shield Strength** of the fortified on-field character by 5% when it takes damage. This can stack up to 5 times and will last for the duration of Jade Shield.
* **A4** allows Zhongli to gain an additional **DMG Bonus** on his **Normal Attacks, Charged Attacks, Elemental Skill,** and **Elemental Burst** based on his maximum **HP**.
* **Elemental Burst** summons a large meteor that deals **AoE** **Geo DMG** and petrifies enemies for several seconds.

## **Additional Notes**

* Zhongliâ€™s Jade Shield Debuffs nearby enemy units' by decreasing their **Elemental and Physical Resistance** by 20%.
* Zhongli's **Stone Stele** additionally causes all other **Geo Constructs** in the nearby area to pulse, dealing additional **Geo DMG**.

* Zhongli can be put into almost any team as a flexible Support. He provides powerful shielding, a universal **Resistance** Debuff, and Crowd Control in a large area.
* Teams containing Zhongli typically do not center around him. He is usually used in an empty slot to enhance other members of the team.
* Zhongli also generally replaces healers, as his shield provides enough damage negation if sustained (especially with his **A1**).

## Does Not Work Well With

* Zhongli does not work well in **Freeze** teams since his **Elemental Skill** pulse triggers the **Shatter** reaction which stops enemies from being **Frozen.**

{% hint style="info" %}
Zhongli can still be used as the 4th character on **Freeze** teams by positioning his **Stone Stele** to not **Shatter Frozen** enemies.

* Zhongli's shielding and **Universal Resistance** Debuffing are especially useful in Xiao teams due to Xiao's poor survivability and the lack of convenient abilities that debuff **Anemo Resistance**. He can also provide **Geo Resonance**.

* Zhongli's Jade Shield and Crowd Control are especially valuable on Ganyu to decrease her vulnerability when performing **Charged Aimed Attacks**.

* Zhongli's Jade Shield allows Eula to **Normal Attack** as much as possible and debuff **Physical Resistance** to fully enhance her **Elemental Burst DMG**.

* Zhongli's Jade Shield allows Hu Tao to perform her **Charged Attack** as much as possible and protects her against enemy attacks if Hu Tao does not have the **Stamina** to dodge.
