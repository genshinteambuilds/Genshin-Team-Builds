# Zhongli

## **Roles**

* **Support:** Shielder, ****Debuffer, Crowd Control \(Immobilization\), Healer \(C6\)
* **Burst DPS**

## **Character Breakdown**

* Zhongli is a universal support. He provides the strongest shield with over 100% uptime and reliable crowd control with his petrify from his Elemental Burst.
* Elemental Skill \(tap\) has a short base cooldown and summons a rock pillar \(Stone Stele, a Geo Construct\) that pulses Geo Damage in short intervals. 
* Holding Zhongli’s Elemental Skill will also summon a Stone Stele \(only if the maximum amount has not been reached yet\) and provide a jade shield based on his maximum HP. 
* Elemental Burst summons a large meteor that deals a large amounts of Geo Damage in a large area around the target and petrifies enemy units for several seconds. 

## **Additional Notes**

* Zhongli’s jade shield debuffs nearby enemy units Elemental and Physical Resistance by 20%. 
* Both Zhongli's damage and shielding abilities scale off of his max HP, making it a much more valuable on him than most other characters. 
* Zhongli's Stone Stele additionally causes all other Geo Constructs in the nearby area to pulse, doing additional Geo Damage.

* Zhongli can be slotted into almost any team composition as a flexible Support. He provides powerful shielding, universal resistance shred, and crowd control in a large area. 

## Does Not Work Well With

* Zhongli does not work well in freeze team compositions since his Elemental Skill pulses shatters frozen enemies.

**NOTE:** Zhongli can still be used as the 4th spot on freeze teams, positioning his Stone Stele would just be crucial for him to not shatter frozen enemies.

**Support**

* Zhongli is a strong inclusion to almost any team composition in the game, due to his universal buffing abilities and flexible kit.
* Teams containing Zhongli typically do not center around him, with him usually being slotted in an empty slot to enhance other members of the team.
* Zhongli also typically allows you to not need to use a healer, as his shield will provide enough durability if sustained.

* Zhongli provides geo resonance as well as decreasing elemental resistances for both a Geo Main-DPS and Off-Field DPS from his jade shield.

* Zhongli's universal resistance decrease on his jade shield and Geo Resonance are especially effective on Xiao due to lack of other ways of reducing enemies' Anemo resistance.

* Zhongli's resistance decrease on his jade shield provides an additional way to enhance Physical Damage.
* His powerful shielding also allows Eula to Normal Attack as much as possible to fully enhance her Elemental Burst's Damage.

* Zhongli's shielding provides lowering enemies resistances, making these pyro dps do more reverse vaporized damage on the enemies while provided with his shield. His Elemental Burst also provides crowd control.

* Ganyu's extremely high damage is boosted even further by Zhongli's jade shield that decreases resistances, and his Crowd Control and protective abilities greatly reduces Ganyu's chances of getting interrupted during her Charged Shot.
