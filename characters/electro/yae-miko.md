# Yae Miko

## Roles

* **Off-Field DPS** (Elemental Skill)
* **Burst DPS**
* **Main DPS**

## **Character Breakdown**

* **Elemental Skill** summons a Sesshou Sakura, which deals an **Electro DMG** to a single enemy for a set duration.
  * Sesshou Sakura can hold up to 3 charges and it starts at level 1. When they are nearby each other its level increases up to maximum of level 3, Which further boost the **Electro DMG** dealt.
* **Elemental Burst** summons a lightning strike which deals a large amount of **AoE Electro DMG**.
  * If there are Sesshou Sakuras on the field it consumes them and Summons extra lightning strikes based on how many are present.
* **A1** reduces the cooldown of Yae Miko's **Elemental Skill** based on the number of Sesshou Sakura present on the field.
* **A2** increases the damage of Sesshou Sakura by 0.15% for every point of Yae Miko's **Elemental Mastery**.

## **Additional Notes**

* **C1** allows Yae Miko's **Elemental Burst** to restore her own energy with every lightning strike summoned when cast.
* **C2** increases the initial of Sesshou Sakura to level 2, max level to 4 and gets an increased attack range.
* **C4** allows Yae Miko's **Elemental Skill** to buff the entire party's **Electro DMG** when it hits enemies.
* **C6** massively increases the damage dealt by the from Yae Miko's **Elemental Skill**.
* **Elemental Skill** does not snapshot from buffs which results in Yae Miko dealing less damage when Off-Field.

## **Works Well With**

* Raiden is one of the best characters to pair with Yae Miko, providing energy, activating **Electro Resonance** as well as damage from her **Elemental Skill** and **Elemental Burst.**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Sara.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)

* Sara and Bennet provides an **ATK** boost that can increase which overall increases Yae Miko's damage output.&#x20;
* Sara however has poor **Energy** **Particle** generation so it is recommended to run a 3rd **Electro** character in the team to serve as an Energy Battery unless it is a [**Oneshot**](../../teams/oneshot.md) team.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Kokomi.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)

* Kokomi and Xingqiu provide a high rate of **Hydro** application and which can constantly create **Electro-Charged** reactions.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Anemo.webp)

* **Anemo** characters pair well with Yae Miko as they can provide **Elemental RES** debuffs with the **Viridescent Venerer** 4-set or other **Elemental DMG** buffs when triggering a **Swirl** reaction.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Fischl.png)

* Provides additional Off-Field **Electro DMG** to compliment Yae Miko and helps generate **Electro Energy Particles** to recharge her **Elemental Burst** and activates **Electro Resonance**.

## **Does Not Work Well With**

* Yae Miko does not pair with most **Pyro** characters because of the **Overload** **Reaction** which can knock enemies away from the attack range of her **Elemental Skill**.
