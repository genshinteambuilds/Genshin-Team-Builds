# Dori

## Roles

* **Support:** Healer

## **Character Breakdown**

* **Elemental Skill** deals **Electro DMG** by firing off Troubleshooters Shots at opponents, which will then fire additional After-Sale Service Rounds which have enemy tracking capabilities.
* **Elemental Burst** creates a **Jinni** lamp which provides healing, **Energy Recharge**, and imbues Electro for the active character.
* **A1** reduces the cooldown of her **Elemental Skill** by 1 second every 3 seconds if an **Electro** related reaction occurs.
* **A4** restores 5 **Elemental** **energy** per 100% of Dori's **Energy Recharge** to the active character when her **Elemental** **Skill** hits opponents.&#x20;

## Additional Notes

* **C4** increases **Incoming Healing** **Bonus** or **Energy Recharge** for active character during **Elemental Burst** if they fall under 50%.
* **C6** gives Dori **Electro Elemental Infusion** on **Normal Attacks.** Additionally, party members will be healed by 4% of Dori's **Max HP.**

* Dori can work in almost any team in the game as a universal Healer.
* It is recommended to pair her with **Hydro** and **Anemo** characters so she can also be utilized to apply **Electro-Charged** reactions.&#x20;
* You can also fit her into a Mono-Geo team to allow her to proc **Crystalized** reactions from off-field whilst healing the active character.

* Dori's focus on healing reduces her synergy with other Healers and Shielders, who often fill the same role.

* Dori's utility as both a healer and **Electro**-applier allows her to be used in a double-**Hydro** composition that allows the use of an **Anemo** support to boost the team's overall **DPS**.

* Allows for more healing potential in a taser team which makes this team composition safer to run than with another **Electro** character such as Beidou.
