# Yae

## Roles

* **Off-Field DPS** (Elemental Skill)
* **Burst DPS**
* **Main DPS**

## **Character Breakdown**

* **Elemental Skill** summons a Sesshou Sakura, which continuously deals **Electro DMG** to a single target for a set duration.
  * **Elemental Skill** has 3 charges and 3 Sesshou Sakura can be on the field at a time.
  * When Sesshou Sakura they are near each other, they increase each other's level up to maximum of 3, Which further boost the **Electro DMG** dealt.
* **Elemental Burst** summons a lightning strike which deals a large amount of **AoE Electro DMG**.
  * If there are Sesshou Sakuras on the field, they are consumed to produce additional lightning strikes.
* **A1** resets the cooldown of Yae's **Elemental Skill** when casting her **Elemental Burst.**
  * The number of charges that get their cooldown reset is based on how many Sesshou Sakuras are present.
* **A4** increases the damage of Sesshou Sakura by 0.15% for every point of Yae's **Elemental Mastery**.

## **Additional Notes**

* **Elemental Skill** and **Elemental Burst** do not snapshot buffs.
* The number of **Electro Particles** gained with Yae's **Elemental Skill** is shared across all Sesshou Sakuras present On-Field.

## **Works Well With**

* Raiden is one of the best characters to pair with Yae, providing energy, activating **Electro Resonance** as well as buffing Yae with her **Elemental Skill**.

* Kokomi and Xingqiu provide **Hydro** application and which can constantly create **Electro-Charged** reactions.
* Kokomi also serves as a healer which frees up another character slot in the team.

* **Anemo** characters pair well with Yae as they can provide **Elemental RES** debuffs with the **Viridescent Venerer** 4-set or other **Elemental DMG** buffs when triggering a **Swirl** reaction.

* Provides additional Off-Field **Electro DMG** to complement Yae's long **Elemental Skill** animation times.
* Generates **Electro Energy Particles** to recharge Yae's **Elemental Burst** and activates **Electro Resonance**.

## **Does Not Work Well With**

****![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_sara.png)****![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_bennett.png)****

{% hint style="info" %}
&#x20;**** These characters are best utilised not with Yae, but in another other team. This dissonance does not mean a DPS loss for this particular team, but rather a DPS loss opportunity cost wise.
{% endhint %}

* Although attack buffers are always welcome, Yae does not have the ability so snapshot. Therefore, the more than half of her damage, which comes from her **Elemental Skill**, is unable to make full use of the attack buff due to the nature of Yae's playstyle as an off-field support.
* Sara's off-field damage buff is arguably too short for Yae to make full use of.

* Raiden provides energy for the entire party and deals damage with her **Elemental Burst** while Yae is Off-Field.
* Alternatively Fischl can be used if Raiden isn't available as an Energy Battery.
