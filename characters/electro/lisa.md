# Lisa

## Roles

* **Off-Field DPS** \(Elemental Burst\)
* **Support:** Debuffer \(C2\)

## Character Breakdown

* Elemental skill applies Electro damage to enemies.
  * Pressing Elemental skill releases a homing Electro orb deal Electro damage and apply 1 stack of the conductive status \(max 3 stacks\)
  * Holding Elemental skill causes lightning to strike down dealing massive Electro damage to all enemies within the area of effect.
    * Deals more damage to enemies with higher conductive stacks.
* Elemental Burst deals continuous Electro damage within its area of effect and knocks back enemies on hit.
  * Ascension talent 4 reduce enemies def by 15% for 10 sec when hit by lighting rose

## Additional Notes

* Often paired with another Electro character to regenerate energy for herself as her Elemental Burst has a high energy requirement.
* Can apply more than 1 stack of conductive status if Lisa’s Elemental skill hit a closely pack enemies or when Lisa’s Elemental skill applies the Overload and Superconduct reactions

## Works Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_razor.png) 

* Lisa's defense reduction from her Elemental Burst greatly helps Razor to deal more damage. Razor being an Electro character also helps Lisa have better uptime on her Elemental burst as it costs 80 energy to activate.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_bennett.png) 

* Bennett provides a way to activate the Overload reaction that helps Lisa build up conductive stacks quicker to ensure Lisa’s Elemental skill hits harder. Bennett also buffs Lisa's attack stat to further increase her damage.

* Venti provides energy particles and Crowd Control to gather up enemies to help Lisa stack her conductive status.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_beidou.png) 

* Beidou enables Electro resonance with Lisa, allowing for both to recharge their bursts much quicker.

## Does Not Work Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_hutao.png)  ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_diluc.png) 

* Hu Tao and Diluc can’t effectively deal with enemies being knocked back by Overload reactions. Thus, using Lisa results in wasting time and sometimes stamina to reach the enemy knocked away by the Overload.

* A typical Physical team composition where Lisa can do burst damage with her Elemental skill in a short period of time due to Kaeya and Diona helping her apply Superconduct increasing Lisa’s conductive stacks on enemies.
* Lisa’s Elemental Burst reduces enemy defense while also dealing damage even when she’s not on-field.

* A team that focuses on sustained damage while also have the option to deal burst damage with both Childe Vaporizing his Elemental Burst with Bennett, as well as Lisa’s Elemental skill.
