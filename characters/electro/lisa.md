# Lisa

## Roles

* **Off-Field DPS** (Elemental Burst)
* **Support**: Debuffer&#x20;

## Character Breakdown

* **Elemental Skill** (Tap) releases a homing **Electro** orb that deals **Electro** damage and applies 1 stack of the **Conductive** status (max 3 stacks).
* **Elemental Skill** (Hold) causes lightning to strike down dealing massive **Electro** damage to all enemies within its AoE.
  * Deals more damage to enemies with higher **Conductive** stacks.
* **Elemental Burst** deals continuous **Electro** damage within its area of effect and knocks back enemies on hit.
  * **A4** reduces enemies **Defense** by 15% for 10 sec when hit by her **Elemental Burst**.

## Additional Notes

* **A1** allows Lisa to apply a stack of the **Conductive** status when she performs a **Charged Attack**.
* Lisa is often paired with another **Electro** character to regenerate energy as her **Elemental Burst** has a high energy requirement.
* Can apply more than 1 stack of the **Conductive** status if Lisa’s **Elemental Skill** hit enemies closely grouped together or when Lisa’s **Elemental Skill** applies the **Overload** or **Superconduct** reactions.

## Works Well With

* Lisa pairs well with **Physical** Main DPS because of her** Defense** reduction from her **Elemental Burst** and **Superconduct** reactions which reduce **Physical Resistance**.
* Razor being an **Electro** character also helps Lisa have better uptime on her **Elemental Burst** because of its high energy requirement.

* Venti provides energy particles and Crowd Control to gather up enemies to help Lisa stack her **Conductive** status.

* Beidou enables **Electro Resonance** with Lisa, allowing for both to recharge their** Elemental Bursts** much quicker.

## Does Not Work Well With

* Lisa's constant **Electro** application can knock enemies out of range when used with a **Pyro** Main DPS due to **Overload's** knockback effect. **Electro** can also interfere with the consistency of **Vaporize** or **Melt** reactions.
