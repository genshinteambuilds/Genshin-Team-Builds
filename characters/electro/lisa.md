# Lisa

## Roles

* **Off-Field DPS** (Elemental Burst)
* **Support**: Debuffer&#x20;

## Character Breakdown

* Elemental skill applies Electro damage to enemies and has 2 mechanics:
  * Pressing Elemental skill releases a homing Electro orb that deals Electro damage and apply 1 stack of the Conductive Status (max 3 stacks)
  * Holding Elemental skill causes lightning to strike down dealing massive Electro damage to all enemies within the area of effect.
    * Deals more damage to enemies with higher conductive stacks.
* Elemental Burst deals continuous Electro damage within its area of effect and knocks back enemies on hit.
  * A4 reduces enemies DEF by 15% for 10 sec when hit by lighting rose.

## Additional Notes

* Lisa's A1 lets her apply a stack of Conductive Status when she performs a Charged Attack.
* Often paired with another Electro character to regenerate energy for herself as her Elemental Burst has a high energy requirement.
* Can apply more than 1 stack of conductive status if Lisa’s Elemental skill hit a closely pack enemies or when Lisa’s Elemental skill applies the Overload and Superconduct reactions

## Works Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Eula.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Razor.png)

* Lisa's defense reduction from her Elemental Burst greatly helps Eula and Razor to deal more damage. Razor being an Electro character also helps Lisa have better uptime on her Elemental burst as it costs 80 energy to activate. She also helps Eula for Superconduct reaction to reduced Phyisical RES.

* Venti provides energy particles and Crowd Control to gather up enemies to help Lisa stack her conductive status.

* Beidou enables Electro resonance with Lisa, allowing for both to recharge their bursts much quicker.

## Does Not Work Well With

* Hu Tao and Diluc can’t effectively deal with enemies being knocked back by Overload reactions. Thus, using Lisa results in wasting time and consuming stamina to reach the enemy knocked away by Overload.

* Lisa’s Elemental Burst reduces enemy defense while also dealing damage even when she’s not on-field.
