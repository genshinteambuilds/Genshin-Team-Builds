## Works Well With

* Lisa DEF reduction from her Elemental Burst greatly helps Razor to deal more damage. Razor being an electro character also helps Lisa have a great uptime on her Elemental burst as it costs 80 energy to activate.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_bennett.png) 

* Bennett provides a way to proc overload reactions that helps Lisa build up a conductive stack quicker to ensure Lisa’s Elemental skill to hit harder. Bennett also buffs Lisa's attack stat to further increase her damage.

* Venti provides energy particles and CC to gather up enemies to help Lisa stack her conductive status.

## Does Not Work Well With
