# Keqing

## **Roles**

* Main DPS \(Cryo and Physical\)
* Sub DPS \(Quickswap\)

## **Character Breakdown**

* Auto Attack: You’re mostly going to be spamming Charged Attacks on Keqing where most of her own damage comes from
* \(E\) Stellar Restoration: Does damage on cast on location, and recasting does damage and infuses Keqing with electro, or hitting it with a Charged Attack causes it to only deal damage instead.
* \(Q\) Starward Sword: Do several slashes and one stronger final slash.
* Passive Talents: After Q, gives 15% crit rate and 15% Energy Recharge.

## **Additional Notes:**

* Keqing can easily run out of stamina due to her needing to spam CA for damage
* Keqing needs her supports to deal strong enough damage as its usually her team/subdps that does most of the damage
* Her Q has low cost making it easier to spam to take advantage of her Ascension passive talent
* Her cons are usually niche as they might be free damage although not that big of an increase
* She doesn’t suffer from downtime as using E &gt; Q &gt; can maximize the duration of her E.

## **Works well with**

* Bennett works with everyone especially on Keqing’s team

* Xingqiu procs electro-charged and adds to the team damage.
* For physical Keqing, he can also be used with a cryo character to freeze the enemies to prevent knockbacks

* Adds to the team damage and if you have her c6, it shreds 15% of Electro Resistance of Enemies.

* His swirls + 40% elemental resistance shred from 4 Piece Viridiscent + Elemental damage bonus makes him easily fit in every team including Keqing

* His petrify + Universal Shred + tanky shield makes him fit in every team.

* Sometimes used for Quickswap Keqing since Keqing Q reaches enemies in Venti’s Q.

* Cryo characters supports physical dmg keqing really due to superconduct.

## **Does Not Work Well With**

\*\*\*\*![](../../.gitbook/assets/element_pyro.webp) ****

* Overload is usually bad on Keqing as it can waste a lot of stamina which she needs to do Charged Attacks

* Standard Electrocharged teams- C6 Beidou helps for Keqing to do more damage as it shreds a bit of electro resistance.
* The Xingqiu Beidou Kazuha team should only be used if you’re confident you can survive with only the damage reduction and Xingqiu’s small heals.

*  just like electro is fairly flexible, it’s usually Keqing + a cryo user then it depends on either you want more damage or utility
