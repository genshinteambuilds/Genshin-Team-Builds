# Keqing

## **Roles**

* **Main DPS** (Electro, Physical)
* **Burst DPS**

## **Character Breakdown**

* **Elemental Skill (Tap)** summons a **Lightning Stiletto** dealing **Electro** damage on enemy, and recasting teleports her to its location and does additional AoE **Electro** damage. If Keqing instead uses a **Charged Attack** the **Lightning Stiletto** explodes and deals **AoE** **Electro** damage.
  * **Elemental Skill (Hold)** allows her to manually aim the **Lightning Stiletto**.
* **A1** infuses Keqing's **Normal and Charged Attacks** with **Electro** for 5 seconds after teleporting with her **Elemental Skill**.
* **Elemental Burst** does several slashes and one stronger final slash in an area around her, dealing **Electro** damage.
* **A4** gives Keqing 15% **Critical Rate** and 15% **Energy Recharge** for 8 seconds after her using her **Elemental Burst**.

## **Additional Notes**

* Keqing can be played as either an **Electro** or **Physical** Main DPS giving her flexibility when it comes to her teams.
* Keqing can easily run out of **Stamina** due to her **Charged Attacks** being her main source of damage.
* She can maintain her **Electro** infusion by using her **Elemental Skill** then using her **Elemental Burst** before recasting the **Elemental Skill**.
* Keqing's **Charged Attack** can often knock back smaller enemies making it difficult to deal consistent damage.

## **Works well with**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)&#x20;

* Bennett's **Elemental Burst** provides healing and a massive **Attack** buff, making him a recommended character in most teams.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)

* Xingqiu's **Elemental Burst** has a high rate of **Hydro** application which allows for constant **Electro-Charged** reactions.
* For **Physical** Keqing, he can also be used with a **Cryo** character to **Freeze** the enemies which prevents knock-back from disrupting her damage.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Beidou.png)

* Beidou contributes to the team's overall damage with her own **Elemental Burst,** and her **C6** debuffs the **Electro Resistance** of enemies'.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Zhongli.png)

* Zhongli's shield blocks a large amount of damage from enemies, allowing Keqing to focus more on dealing damage rather than dodging. It also reduces enemy **Resistances**. Zhongli's **Elemental Burst** provides a **Petrify** debuff to enemies allowing for a window to attack without worrying about knock-back from Keqing's **Charged Attacks**.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Anemo.webp)

* Keqing pairs well with **Anemo** characters as the **Viridescent Venerer** 4-set can debuff **Electro** **Resistance** on enemies.
* Kazuha provides buffs to **Elemental Damage** with **Swirl** reactions.
* Venti is used primarily on **Electro** Keqing teams. He can keep enemies grouped and damage can be dealt to all enemies trapped in his Elemental Burst with Keqing's **Elemental Skill** and **Burst**.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Cryo.webp)&#x20;

* Cryo support characters such work well with **Physical** Keqing as the **Superconduct** **Elemental Reaction** debuffs enemies' **Physical Resistance**.

## Does Not Work Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Chongyun.png)

* Chongyun's **Elemental Skill** can infuse Keqing with **Cryo** which does not benefit from **Superconduct** for **Physical** Keqing, and it also overrides **Electro** Keqing's infusion from her **Elemental Skill**.
  * Chongyun can however be used with **Cryo** Keqing but it is very niche and generally not recommended, as it prevents Keqing from using her **Elemental Skills**.

****[**Electro-Charged (Electro)**](../../teams/electro-charged.md)****

****![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Keqing.png)****![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)****![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Beidou.png)****![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)****

* This team mainly uses Xingqiu and Beidou's **Elemental Bursts** to increase Keqing's **Charged Attack** damage and provide **Electro-Charged** reactions.
* Beidou's **C6** debuffs **Electro Resistance** which increases Keqing's total damage output.
* Kazuha can replace Bennett as he provides an **Elemental Damage** bonus and **Electro Resistance** debuff with **Viridescent Venerer** 4-set, but he cannot provide the survivability that Bennett provides with his healing.
* Jean can replace Bennett or Kazuha in which case she provides both an **Electro Resistance** debuff with **Viridescent** **Venerer** 4-set and healing but does not increase Keqing's damage as much compared to Bennett and Kazuha.

****[**Physical (Electro)**](../../teams/physical.md)****

****![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Keqing.png)****![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Kaeya.png)****![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)****![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Diona.png)****

* This team mainly relies on the **Superconduct** Reaction which debuffs **Physical Resistance**.
* Do not recast Keqing's **Elemental Skill**. It should be detonated via **Charged Attack** to avoid **Electro** infusion.
* The 3rd and 4th slots in the team are flexible and their main role is to provide buffs, debuffs or other utility effects.
