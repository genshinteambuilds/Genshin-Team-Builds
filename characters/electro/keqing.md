# Keqing

## **Roles**

* **Main DPS** (**Electro**,**Physical**)
* **Burst DPS**

## **Character Breakdown**

* **Elemental Skill** does damage on cast at the location, and recasting teleports her to the location and does additional **Electro **damage. Activating it with a **Charged Attack** causes it to only deal **Electro** damage in the area instead.
* **A1 Infuses** Keqing's **Normal and Charged Attacks** with **Electro** for 5 seconds after recasting. This does not trigger if activated with a **Charge Attack**.
* **Elemental Burst **does several slashes and one stronger final slash in an area around her, dealing **Electro **damage.
* **A4** gives Keqing 15% **Crit Rate** and 15% **Energy Recharge** for 8s after her using her **Elemental Burst**.

## **Additional Notes**

* Keqing can easily run out of stamina due to her **Charged Attacks** being her main source of damage.
* Her constellations are usually niche as they mostly are just extra damage. The damage increase from them tends to be quite small.
* She can maintain maximum **Electro Infusion** time by using her **Elemental Skill** then using her **Elemental Burst **before recasting the **Elemental Skill**.
* Keqing can be played as either an **Electro** or **Physical** Main DPS giving her flexibility when it comes to her teams.
* Keqing's **Charged Attack** can often knock back smaller enemies making it difficult to deal consistent damage.

## **Works well with**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)&#x20;

* Bennett's **Elemental Burst** provides healing and a massive **Attack** buff, making him a recommended character in most teams.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)

* Xingqiu's **Elemental Burst** has a high rate of **Hydro** application which allows for constant **Electro-Charged** reactions.
* For **Physical** damage Keqing, he can also be used with a **Cryo** character to freeze the enemies which prevents knock-back from disrupting her damage.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Beidou.png)

* Beidou contribute to the team's overall damage with her own **Elemental Burst** and her C6 debuffs the **Electro Resistance** of enemies.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Zhongli.png)

* Zhongli's shield blocks a large amount of damage, allowing for more focus on dealing damage. It also reduces enemy **Resistances**. Zhongli's **Elemental Burst** provides a petrify debuff to enemies allowing for a window to attack without worrying about dodging.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Anemo.webp)

* Keqing pairs well with **Anemo** characters as the **Viridescent Venerer** 4-set can debuff **Electro** **Resistance** on enemies.
* Kazuha provides buffs to **Elemental Damage** with **Swirl** Reactions.
* Venti is used primarily on **Electro** Keqing teams. He can keep enemies grouped and damage can be dealt to all enemies trapped in his Elemental Burst with Keqing's **Elemental Skill** and **Burst**.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Cryo.webp)&#x20;

* Cryo support characters such work well with **Physical** damage Keqing as the **Superconduct **Reaction debuffs enemies **Physical Resistance**.

## Does Not Work Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Chongyun.png)

* Chongyun's **Elemental Skill** can infuse Keqing with **Cryo** which does not benefit from **Superconduct** for **Physical** damage Keqing, and it also overrides **Electro** damage Keqing's **Infusion** from her **Elemental Skill**.
  * Chongyun can however be used with **Cryo** damage Keqing but it is very niche and generally not recommended, as it prevents Keqing from using her **Elemental Skill**.

****[**Electro-Charged (Electro)**](../../teams/electro-charged.md)****

****![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Keqing.png)****![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)****![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Beidou.png)****![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)****

* This team mainly uses Xingqiu and Beidou's **Elemental Bursts** to increase Keqing's **Charged Attack** damage and provide **Electro-Charged** reactions.
* Beidou's **C6** debuffs **Electro Resistance** which increases Keqing's total damage output.
* Kazuha can replace Bennett as he provides an **Elemental Damage** bonus and **Electro Resistance** debuff with **Viridescent Venerer** 4-set, but he cannot provide the survivability that Bennett provides.
* Jean can replace Bennett or Kazuha in which case she provides both an **Electro Resistance **debuff with **Viridescent** **Venerer** 4-set and healing but does not increase Keqing's damage as much.

****[**Overload**](../../teams/overload.md)****

****![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Keqing.png)****![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xiangling.png)****![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Venti.png)

* This team relies upon increasing Xiangling and Keqing's damage through the **Overload **reaction and Venti's **Swirl** reaction.
* **Thundering Fury** 4-set is recommended to reduce the **Elemental Burst **cooldown of Keqing.
* Small enemies that often get knocked back by the **Overload** reaction are dealt with using Venti's **Elemental Burst** infused with **Pyro **and Keqing's** Elemental Burst**.

****[**Physical**](../../teams/physical.md)****

****![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Keqing.png)****![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Kaeya.png)****![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)****![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Diona.png)****

* This team mainly relies on the **Superconduct** Reaction which debuffs **Physical Resistance**.
* Do not recast Keqing's **Elemental Skill**. It should be detonated via **Charged Attack** to avoid **Electro Infusion**.
* The 3rd and 4th slots in the team are flexible and their main role is to provide buffs, debuffs or other utility effects.
