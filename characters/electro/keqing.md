# Keqing

## **Roles**

* **Main DPS** \(Electro and Physical\)

## **Character Breakdown**

* Auto Attack: You’re mostly going to be spamming Charged Attacks on Keqing where most of her own damage comes from for teams reliant upon her dps.
* Elemental Skill - Stellar Restoration: Does damage on cast on location, and recasting does damage and infuses Keqing with electro. Activating it with a Charged Attack causes it to only deal damage instead, which is what is done for physical Keqing.
* Elemental Burst - Starward Sword: Does several slashes and one stronger final slash in an area around her.
* Passive Talents: After burst, gives 15% crit rate and 15% Energy Recharge.

## **Additional Notes:**

* Keqing can easily run out of stamina due to her spamming charged attacks for damage
* Electro Keqing needs her supports to deal strong enough damage as supporting characters make up for a large portion of the team's overall damage output.
* Her burst has low cost and cooldown making it easier to spam to take advantage of her Ascension passive talent
* Her constellations are usually niche as they mostly are just extra damage. The damage increase from them tends to be quite small.
* She can maintain maximum infusion time via using her skill then bursting before reactivating the skill.

## **Works well with**

\*\*\*\*![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_bennett.png) ****

* Bennett burst provides healing and additional attack, which is always welcome on the team.

* Xingqiu burst allows for constant electro-charged application.
* For physical Keqing, he can also be used with a cryo character to freeze the enemies to prevent knock-back from disrupting your damage.

* Adds to the team's overall damage and if you have her sixth constellation, it shreds 15% of Electro Resistance of Enemies.

* He provides buffs to elemental damage \(and elemental mastery via his 2nd constellation\), as well as being able to carry the Viridescent Venerer set to lower enemy electo resistance.

* His shield blocks a large amount of damage, allowing for more focus on dealing damage. It also reduces enemy resistances. His burst provides a petrify debuff to enemies allowing for a window to attack without worrying about dodging.

* Used primarily on Electro Keqing teams. Keeps enemies grouped and damage can be dealt to all enemies trapped in his burst with Keqing's skill and burst.

* Cryo support characters such as Diona work well with physical damage Keqing as superconduct lowers enemy physical resistances.

[Overload](../../teams/overload.md)

* Overload team relies upon supplementing Xiangling and Keqing's personal damage with overload reaction damage and Venti's swirl damage.
* Thundering Fury set is recommended to reduce burst cooldown of Keqing.
* Lighter enemies that may inconvenience you due to overload's knockback are dealt with Venti's tornado infused with Pyro and Keqing's burst.

[Electro-Charged](../../teams/electro-charged.md)

* Standard Electrocharged team using electro-charged reaction and Xingqiu + Beidou's bursts to supplement Keqing's charged attack damage.
* Beidou's sixth constellation help for Keqing to do more damage as it shreds a bit of electro resistance.
* The Xingqiu Beidou Kazuha team should only be used if you’re confident you can survive with only the damage reduction and Xingqiu’s small heals.
* Jean can replace Bennett/Kazuha in which case she is used for healing and applying Viridescent Venerer to the enemy.

* No reactions to benefit from. The goal is to activate your buffs/debuffs and try to keep using skills and bursts as they come up, filling downtime with Keqing's charged attack.
* Jean can replace Bennett/Kazuha in which case she is used for healing and applying Viridescent Venerer.

[Physical](../../teams/physical.md)

*  Physical team relying upon superconduct, which is activated by applying cryo before using Keqing's elemental skill.
* Do not recast Keqing's elemental skill. It should be detonated via charged attack to avoid electro infusion.
* Other slots on team should be used to supplement damage via buffs and debuffs, or applying additional effects.
