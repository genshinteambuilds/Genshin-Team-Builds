# Keqing

## **Roles**

* **Main DPS** (Electro, Physical)
* **Burst DPS**

## **Character Breakdown**

* Elemental Skill does damage on cast at the location, and recasting teleports her to the place and does Electro Damage. Activating it with a Charged Attack causes it to only deal Electro Damage in the area instead.
* A1 infuses Keqing's attacks with electro after teleporting for 5s, does not work if activated with a charge attack
* Elemental Burst does several slashes and one stronger final slash in an area around her, dealing Electro Damage
* A4 gives Keqing 15% crit rate and 15% Energy Recharge for 8s after her Elemental Burst

## **Additional Notes**

* Keqing can easily run out of stamina due to her spamming charged attacks as her main source of damage.
* Her constellations are usually niche as they mostly are just extra damage. The damage increase from them tends to be quite small.
* She can maintain maximum infusion time via using her skill then bursting before reactivating the skill.

## **Works well with**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)&#x20;

* Bennett burst provides healing and additional attack, which is always welcome on the team.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)

* Xingqiu burst allows for constant electro-charged application.
* For physical Keqing, he can also be used with a cryo character to freeze the enemies to prevent knock-back from disrupting your damage.

* Adds to the team's overall damage and if you have her sixth constellation, it shreds 15% of Electro Resistance of Enemies.

* He provides buffs to elemental damage (and elemental mastery via his 2nd constellation), as well as being able to carry the Viridescent Venerer set to lower enemy electo resistance.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Zhongli.png)

* His shield blocks a large amount of damage, allowing for more focus on dealing damage. It also reduces enemy resistances. His burst provides a petrify debuff to enemies allowing for a window to attack without worrying about dodging.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Venti.png)

* Used primarily on Electro Keqing teams. Keeps enemies grouped and damage can be dealt to all enemies trapped in his burst with Keqing's skill and burst.

* Cryo support characters such as Diona work well with physical damage Keqing as superconduct lowers enemy physical resistances.

****[**Overload**](../../teams/overload.md)****

****![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Keqing.png)****![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xiangling.png)****![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Venti.png)

* Overload team relies upon supplementing Xiangling and Keqing's personal damage with overload reaction damage and Venti's swirl damage.
* Thundering Fury set is recommended to reduce burst cooldown of Keqing.
* Lighter enemies that may inconvenience you due to overload's knockback are dealt with Venti's tornado infused with Pyro and Keqing's burst.

****[**Electro-Charged**](../../teams/electro-charged.md)****

****![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Keqing.png)****![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)****![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Beidou.png)****![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)****

* Standard Electrocharged team using electro-charged reaction and Xingqiu + Beidou's bursts to supplement Keqing's charged attack damage.
* Beidou's sixth constellation help for Keqing to do more damage as it shreds a bit of electro resistance.
* Replace Bennett with Kazuha only if you’re confident you can survive with only the damage reduction and Xingqiu’s small heals.
* Jean can replace Bennett/Kazuha in which case she is used for healing and applying Viridescent Venerer to the enemy.

**Mono Electro**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Keqing.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Beidou.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Fischl.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)

* No reactions to benefit from. The goal is to activate your buffs/debuffs and try to keep using skills and bursts as they come up, filling downtime with Keqing's charged attack.
* Replace Bennett with Kazuha only if you’re confident you can survive without healing
* Jean can replace Bennett/Kazuha in which case she is used for healing and applying Viridescent Venerer.

****[**Physical**](../../teams/physical.md)****

****![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Keqing.png)****![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Kaeya.png)****![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)****![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Diona.png)****

* Physical team relying upon superconduct, which is activated by applying cryo before using Keqing's elemental skill.
* Do not recast Keqing's elemental skill. It should be detonated via charged attack to avoid electro infusion.
* Other slots (3 and 4)on team should be used to supplement damage via buffs and debuffs, or applying additional effects.
