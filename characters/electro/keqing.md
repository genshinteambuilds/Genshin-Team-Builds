# Keqing

## **Roles**

* **Main DPS** (Electro, Physical)
* **Burst DPS**

## **Character Breakdown**

* **Elemental Skill (Tap)** summons a Lightning Stiletto, dealing **Electro DMG** to enemies.
  * Recasting her **Elemental Skill** teleports her to its location and deals additional **AoE Electro DMG**.
  * If Keqing instead uses a **Charged Attack**, the Lightning Stiletto explodes and deals **AoE** **Electro** **DMG**.
  * **A1** infuses Keqing's **Normal** and **Charged Attacks** with **Electro** for 5 seconds after teleporting with her **Elemental Skill**.
* **Elemental Skill (Hold)** allows her to manually aim the Lightning Stiletto.
* **Elemental Burst** deals **AoE** **Electro** **DMG**.
  * **A4** gives Keqing 15% **CRIT Rate** and 15% **Energy Recharge** for 8 seconds after her using her **Elemental Burst**.

## **Additional Notes**

* Keqing can be played as either an **Electro** or **Physical** Main DPS.
* Keqing can easily run out of **Stamina** due to her **Charged Attacks** being her main source of damage.
* She can maintain her **Electro** Infusion by using her **Elemental Skill** then using her **Elemental Burst** before recasting the **Elemental Skill**.
* Keqing's **Charged Attack** can often Knock-back smaller enemies making it difficult to deal consistent damage.

## **Works well with**

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)

* Bennett's **Elemental Burst** provides healing and a massive **ATK** buff, making him a recommended character in most teams.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)

* Xingqiu's **Elemental Burst** has a high rate of **Hydro** application which allows for constant **Electro-Charged** reactions.
* For **Physical** Keqing, he can also be used with a **Cryo** character to **Freeze** the enemies which prevents Knock-back from disrupting her attacks.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Beidou.png)

* Beidou contributes to the team's overall damage with her own **Elemental Burst,** and her **C6** debuffs the **Electro RES** of enemies.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Zhongli.png)

* Zhongli's shield blocks a large amount of damage from enemies, allowing Keqing to focus more on dealing damage rather than dodging. It also reduces enemy **RES**. Zhongli's **Elemental Burst** provides a **Petrify** debuff to enemies allowing for a window to attack without worrying about Knock-back from Keqing's **Charged Attacks**.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Anemo.webp)

* Keqing pairs well with **Anemo** characters as the **Viridescent Venerer** 4-set can debuff **Electro** **RES** on enemies.
* Kazuha provides buffs to **Elemental DMG** with **Swirl** reactions.
* Venti is used primarily on **Electro** Keqing teams. He can keep enemies grouped and damage can be dealt to all enemies trapped in his **Elemental Burst** with Keqing's **Elemental Skill** and **Burst**.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Cryo.webp)

* **Cryo** support characters such work well with **Physical** Keqing as the **Superconduct** **Elemental Reaction** debuffs enemies' **Physical RES**.

## Does Not Work Well With

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Chongyun.png)

* Chongyun's **Elemental Skill** will infuse Keqing's **Normal** and **Charged Attacks** with **Cryo**. This also overrides Keqing's **Electro** infusion from her **Elemental Skill.**

* Venti is almost a requirement in this team due to **Overload** causing knockback on smaller enemies.

* Do not recast Keqing's **Elemental Skill**. It should be detonated via **Charged Attack** to avoid **Electro** infusion.
* The 3rd and 4th slots in the team are flexible and their main role is to provide buffs, debuffs or other utility effects.
