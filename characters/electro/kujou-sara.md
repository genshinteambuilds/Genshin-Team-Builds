# Sara

## **Roles**

* **Support:** Buffer
* **Burst DPS**

## **Character Breakdown**

* **Elemental Skill** causes Kujou Sara to dash backward and gain a buff to her next **** Aimed Shot.&#x20;
  * This Aimed shot will leave a Crowfeather on the floor for a brief period before detonating, dealing **Electro** **Damage** in an area and triggering Tengu Juurai, buffing the **Attack** of any active party member within the explosion based on Kujou Sara’s own Base **Attack**.
* **Elemental Burst** will summon a lightning strike to deal a massive amount of initial **Electro** **Damage** before spreading out into smaller lightning strikes for additional **Electro Damage**.
  * The lightning strikes can also trigger **Tengu Juurai** and provide the **Attack** boost from Kujou Sara’s **Elemental Skill** for active party members.
* **A1** will greatly boost the speed at which Aimed Shots empowered by her **Elemental Skill** charge up, making it much easier to activate.
* **A4** allows Kujou Sara to generate bonus **Energy** for the team based on her own **Energy Recharge** when her **Elemental Skill** hits opponents.

## **Additional Notes**

* Kujou Sara focuses on buffing the **Attack** of other characters but is also capable of dealing a large amount of **Elemental Burst** damage herself.
* Kujou Sara’s **Attack** Buff will only benefit the active character and has a very short duration of 6 seconds
* **Energy** will only be generated from the explosion after an **** Aimed Shot from Kujou Sara’s **Elemental Skill**. The activation itself will not generate particles.
* **C2** creates a Crowfeather upon activation, greatly increasing the speed and ease at which she can provide her **Attack** buff.
  * This Crowfeather however will not generate **Energy Particles**, and will still require Kujou Sara to perform an Aimed Shot **** to summon the 2nd Crowfeather **** in order to generate them.
* **C6** provides a 60% **Critical Damage** Buff on any **Electro Damage** dealt by characters that have their **Attack** buffed by Tengu Juurai.

## **Works Well With**

****![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Shougun.png)****

* Raiden Shogun is great when paired with Kujou Sara, they can feed each other high amounts of Energy **** to help offset their high **Elemental Burst** costs while Sara functions as a powerful damage buffer for the Raiden Shogun.

* Beidou can benefit from Kujou Sara’s utility and buffs in the same way the Raiden Shogun can. She both helps Beidou recharge her **Elemental Burst** and increases Beidou’s **Elemental Burst** damage, as Beidou can snapshot Kujou Sara’s **Attack** buff.
  * **C6** Kujou Sara's **Critical Damage** Buff cannot be snapshot and will not benefit Beidou’s **Elemental Burst** throughout its entire duration.

* Kujou Sara can provide **Superconduct** and **Attack** Buff to a **Physical** Main DPS that is **Cryo**, though there are often better alternatives for this role.

## **Does Not Work Well With**

* Kujou Sara is relatively straightforward and her abilities do not have lengthy lingering effects that could cause her to mess up other **Elemental Reactions**. She is a solid option as an offensive Support for most teams. &#x20;

## **Teams**

****[**Electro-Charged (Electro)**](../../teams/electro-charged.md)****

* This team has a strong Energy economy and mainly focuses on increasing Beidou's **Elemental Burst** damage with powerful **Attack** Buffs provided by Bennett and Kujou Sara along with consistent **Electro-Charged** reactions for strong sustained DPS.

****[**Oneshot**](../../teams/oneshot.md)****

* Sara provides an **Attack** buff, as well as **Electro Particle** generation for Raiden Shogun. She can also provide an **Electro** **Critical Damage** Buff with **C6**
* Kazuha buffs this **Elemental Burst** even further with **Viridescent Venerer** and his built-in **Elemental Damage** Buff.&#x20;
* Bennett acts as the team's healer while providing additional **Attack** from his **Elemental Burst**.
* This team is much more effective with Raiden Shogun's **C2.**
