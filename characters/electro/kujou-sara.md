# Kujou Sara

## **Roles**

* **Support:** Buffer
* **Burst DPS**

## **Character Breakdown**

* Kujou Sara focuses on buffing the ATK of other members of her party and is also capable of dealing large Burst damage herself.
* Elemental Skill causes Kujou Sara to dash backwards and gain a buff to her next Aimed shot. This Aimed shot will leave a Crowfeather on the floor for a brief period before detonating, dealing Electro damage in an area and triggering Tengu Juurai, buffing the ATK of any active party member within the explosion based on Kujou Sara’s own base ATK.
* Elemental Burst will summon a lightning strike to deal a massive amount of initial Electro Damage before spreading out into smaller lightning strikes for additional Electro hits, these lightning strikes can also trigger Tengu Juurai and provide same ATK boost from Kujou Sara’s Elemental Skill for active party members.
* With her Ascension 4 talent, Kujou Sara will also generate bonus Energy for the team based on her own Energy Recharge when her Elemental Skill hits opponents.

## **Additional Notes**

* Kujou Sara’s first Ascension talent will greatly boost the speed at which Aimed Shots empowered by her Elemental Skill charge up, making it much easier to activate.
* Kujou Sara’s ATK buff will only benefit the active character, and has a very short duration of 6 seconds
* Energy will only be generated from the explosion after an Aimed shot from Kujou Sara’s Elemental Skill, the activation itself will not generate particles.
* Constellation 2 creates a Crowfeather upon activation, greatly increasing the speed and ease at which she can provide her ATK buff.
* Constellation 6 is one of the most powerful Electro buffs in the game currently, providing 60% Crit Damage on any Electro Damage dealt by characters that have their ATK buffed by Tengu Juurai.

## **Works Well With**

* Raiden Shogun is great when paired with Kujou Sara, they can feed each other high amounts of Energy to help offset their high Elemental Burst costs while Sara functions as a powerful damage buffer for the Raiden Shogun.

* Beidou can benefit from Kujou Sara’s utility and buffs in the same way the Raiden Shogun can, with Kujou Sara helping Beidou with her Elemental Burst upkeep and increasing Beidou’s Burst damage thanks to being able to snapshot Kujou Sara’s ATK buff (keep in mind for those with Sara’s Constellation 6, the additional Crit Damage cannot be snapshot and will not benefit Beidou’s Burst throughout its entire duration)

* Kujou Sara can provide Superconduct and ATK buff to a Physical Main DPS that is Cryo, though there are often better alternatives for this role.

## **Does Not Work Well With**

* Kujou Sara is relatively straightforward and her abilities do not have lengthy lingering effects that could cause her to mess up other elemental reactions, therefore she is a solid option as an offensive Support for most teams. &#x20;

## **Teams**

* This team composition focuses on providing buffs to Raiden to maximize her damage during burst. This has the upside of high damage output during the burst, but very low damage output during any downtime.
* Sara is used here to provide her ATK buff as well as her Crit Damage buff to Electro (from her Constellation 6), as well as Electro particle generation for Raiden.
* Kazuha buffs this burst even further with Viridescent Venerer and his built in elemental damage buff.&#x20;
* Bennett acts as the team's healer while providing additional ATK from his burst.

* Another team with strong Energy Economy that focuses on increasing Beidou's Elemental Burst damage with powerful ATK buffs provided by Bennett and Kujou Sara along with consistent Electro-Charged application for strong sustained DPS.
