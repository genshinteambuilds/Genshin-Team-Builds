# Fischl

## Roles

* **Off-Field DPS** (Elemental Skill, Elemental Burst)
* **Main DPS**

## Character Breakdown

* Fischl primarily uses her Elemental Skill to deal sustained Electro Damage from off-field.
* Elemental Skill summons Oz, who deals a large burst of damage upon summon and periodically deals Electro damage to a single enemy for a set duration. 
  * Oz remains even when Fischl is not on the field.
* Reactivating Fischl’s Elemental Skill while it’s already active will teleport Oz to her current location.
* Fischl’s Elemental Burst will cause her to damage all enemies she comes into contact with during its duration and immediately summon Oz.

## Additional Notes

* Fischl’s Elemental Burst is currently the only Burst that does not provide Invincible Frames. Her movement can also be manually controlled during its animation.
* Fischl’s Elemental Burst can also be canceled early by swapping to another character.
* C6 benefits characters who attack frequently, as it applies a small secondary Electro hit on each attack.

## Works Well With

* Fischl can help supplement Beidou's high Energy Recharge requirements.

* Fischl allows Razor to use his Elemental Burst more frequently. She also does not take up Razor's field time.

## Does Not Work Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_hutao.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_diluc.png) 

* Fischl’s constant Electro application can knock enemies out of range when used with someone like Hu Tao or Diluc due to Overload's knockback effect. Electro can also interfere with the consistency of Vaporize reactions. 
  * However, some teams can still function this way. See [Overload](../../teams/overload.md).

[**Electro-Charged**](../../teams/electro-charged.md)****

* This team composition utilizes both Hydro and Electro characters who individually provide strong personal damage coupled with high energy generation from Electro resonance, providing good sustained area damage.

****[**Physical**](../../teams/physical.md)****

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_eula.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_fischl.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_diona.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_zhongli.png) 

* Fischl pairs well with Physical carries, especially Cryo ones thanks to her high Superconduct uptime. She also helps provide extra damage without requiring much field time.
