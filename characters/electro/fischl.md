# Fischl

## Roles

* Sub DPS \(Electro\)

## Character Breakdown

* Fischl primarily uses her Elemental Skill to deal sustained Electro Damage from off-field.
* Elemental Skill summons Oz, a pet that deals a larger burst of damage when it appears then continues to damage a single enemy with Electro for a set duration, which remains even when Fischl isn’t on the field.
* Reactivating Fischl’s Elemental Skill while it’s already active will teleport Oz to her current location.
* Fischl’s Elemental burst will cause her to damage all enemies she comes into contact with during its duration and immediately summon Oz, this can greatly extend Oz’s uptime.

## Additional Notes

* Fischl’s Elemental Burst is unique and is the only Burst currently in the game that does not provide Invincible Frames and her movement can be manually controlled during its animation.
* Fischl’s Elemental Burst can also be cancelled early by swapping to another character.

## Works Well With

* Eula can benefit from the high Superconduct uptime and extra damage provided by Fischl.

* Tartaglia can proc Electro-Charged very frequently with Fischl for a strong boost to your sustained and AoE damage.

* Razor typically wants an Electro battery for Burst upkeep and Fischl can provide that on top of some extra DPS.

## Does Not Work Well With

* Fischl’s constant Electro procs can fling enemies out of your DPS when combod with someone like Hu Tao due to Overload on top of taking away her Vaporize/Melt reactions.

* This comp utilizes both Hydro and Electro characters who individually provide strong DPS coupled with high energy generation from Electro resonance for high sustained AoE DPS.

* \(Eula/Fischl/Diona/Zhongli\) Fischl pairs well with Physical carries, especially Cryo ones thanks to her high Superconduct uptime, she also helps provide extra off-field DPS.
