# Fischl

## Roles

* **Off-Field DPS** (Elemental Skill, Elemental Burst)
* **Main DPS**

## Character Breakdown

* **Elemental Skill** summons **Oz**, who deals a large burst of AoE **Electro** damage upon summon and periodically deals **Electro** damage to a single enemy for a set duration.
  * **Oz** remains even when Fischl is not on the field.
* Reactivating Fischl’s **Elemental Skill** while it’s already active will teleport **Oz** to her current location.
* **Elemental Burst** will cause Fischl to damage all enemies she comes into contact with during its duration and immediately summon** Oz**.

## Additional Notes

* **Elemental Skill** is primarily used to deal sustained **Electro** damage from off-field.
* Fischl’s **Elemental Burst** is currently the only **Elemental Burst** that does not provide Invincibility Frames. Her movement can also be manually controlled during its animation.
* **Elemental Burst** can be canceled early by swapping to another character.
* **C6 **benefits characters who attack frequently, as it applies a small secondary **Electro** hit on each attack.

## Works Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Eula.png)

* Eula can benefit from frequent **Superconduct** reactions which debuffs **Physical Resistance,** and the extra **Electro **damage provided by Fischl.

* Tartaglia and Xingqiu provide a high rate of **Hydro **application, and combined with Fischl's **Oz** she can constantly create **Electro-Charged** reactions.

* Fischl's **Electro Particle** generation can help recharge Beidou's high cost** Elemental Burst.**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Razor.png)

* Fischl provides **Electro Particles **and** Electro Resonance** allowing Razor to use his **Elemental Burst** more frequently.

## Does Not Work Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Pyro.webp)

* Fischl’s constant **Electro** application can knock enemies out of range when used with a **Pyro **Main DPS due to **Overload's** knockback effect. **Electro** can also interfere with the consistency of **Vaporize** or **Melt** reactions.
  * However, some teams can still function this way. See [**Overload**](../../teams/overload.md).

* This team utilizes both **Hydro** and **Electro** characters who provide strong individual damage coupled with high energy generation from **Electro Resonance** and frequent **Electro-Charged** reactions, resulting in high sustained area damage.

* Fischl pairs well with **Physical** Main DPS because of frequent **Superconduct** reactions, which debuffs **Physical Resistance**. She also helps provide extra damage without requiring much field time.
