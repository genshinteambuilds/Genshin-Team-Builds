# Fischl

## Roles

* **Off-Field DPS**
* **Main DPS**

## Character Breakdown

* Fischl primarily uses her Elemental Skill to deal sustained Electro Damage from off-field.
* Elemental Skill summons Oz, a pet that deals a large burst of damage when it appears then continues to damage a single enemy with Electro for a set duration, which remains even when Fischl isn’t on the field.
* Reactivating Fischl’s Elemental Skill while it’s already active will teleport Oz to her current location.
* Fischl’s Elemental Burst will cause her to damage all enemies she comes into contact with during its duration and immediately summon Oz, this can greatly extend Oz’s uptime.

## Additional Notes

* Fischl’s Elemental Burst is unique and is the only Burst currently in the game that does not provide Invincible Frames and her movement can be manually controlled during its animation.
* Fischl’s Elemental Burst can also be cancelled early by swapping to another character.
* Fischl's sixth constellation benefits from characters who attack frequently, as it applies a small secondary Electro hit on attack.

## Works Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_eula.png) ****

* Eula can benefit from the high Superconduct uptime and extra damage provided by Fischl.

* Tartaglia can apply Electro-Charged very frequently with Fischl for a boost to your sustained and area damage.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_razor.png) 

* Fischl provides Razor with a consistent source of energy generation, allowing him to use his burst much more frequently. Razor is also a character that wants to be the active character most of the time, and Fischl does not need to be switched in very often and for very long to perform her job.

## Does Not Work Well With

* Fischl’s constant Electro application can fling enemies out of your DPS when used with someone like Hu Tao or Diluc due to Overload's knockback effect. She can also interfere with the consistency of vaporize reactions which can lower the total amount of damage being dealt.

* This team composition utilizes both Hydro and Electro characters who individually provide strong personal damage coupled with high energy generation from Electro resonance, providing good sustained area damage.

* Fischl pairs well with Physical carries, especially Cryo ones thanks to her high Superconduct uptime. She also helps provide extra damage without requiring much field time.
