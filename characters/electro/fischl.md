# Fischl

## Roles

* **Off-Field DPS** (Elemental Skill, Elemental Burst)
* **Main DPS** (Not Recommended)

## Character Breakdown

* **Elemental Skill** summons Oz, who deals a large burst of **AoE** **Electro DMG** and then periodically deals **Electro DMG** to a single enemy for a set duration.
  * Oz remains even when Fischl is not on the field.
* Reactivating Fischl’s **Elemental Skill** while it’s already active will re-summon Oz at her current location.
* **Elemental Burst** will cause Fischl to deal **Electro DMG** all enemies she comes into contact with during its duration and summons Oz at the end of it's use.

## Additional Notes

* Oz is primarily used to deal sustained **Electro DMG** from Off-Field.
* Fischl’s **Elemental Burst** is currently the only **Elemental Burst** that does not provide Invincibility Frames. Her movement can also be manually controlled during its animation.
* **Elemental Burst** can be cancelled early by swapping to another character.
* **C6** benefits characters who attack frequently, as it applies a small secondary **Electro** hit on each attack.

## Works Well With

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Eula.png)

* Eula can benefit from frequent **Superconduct** reactions which debuff **Physical RES**.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Tartaglia.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)

* Tartaglia and Xingqiu provide a high rate of **Hydro** application and combined with Fischl's Oz, can constantly create **Electro-Charged** reactions.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Beidou.png)

* Fischl's **Electro Energy Particle** generation can help recharge Beidou's high cost **Elemental Burst.**

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Razor.png)

* Fischl provides **Electro Energy Particles** and **Electro Resonance** allowing Razor to use his **Elemental Burst** more frequently.

## Does Not Work Well With

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Pyro.webp)

* Fischl’s constant **Electro** application can knock enemies out of range when used with a **Pyro** Main DPS due to **Overload's** knock back effect. **Electro** can also interfere with the consistency of **Vaporize** or **Melt** reactions.
  * However, some teams can still function this way. See [**Overload**](../../teams/overload.md).

* Fischl pairs well with **Physical** Main DPS because of frequent **Superconduct** reactions, which debuff **Physical RES**. She also helps provide extra Off-Field **Electro DMG** without requiring much time spent on her character.
