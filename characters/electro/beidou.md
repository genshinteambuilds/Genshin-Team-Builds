# Beidou

## Roles

* **Off-Field DPS** (Elemental Burst)
* **Support:** Debuffer (C6), Cleanser (Self Only)

## Character Breakdown

* **Elemental Skill** provides a brief shield based off of her total **HP**. Attacks taken by this shield while Beidou holds up her **Elemental Skill** determine the damage of the counterattack performed when the **Elemental Skill** is released. 2 attacks are required to reach the maximum damage.
  * **A1** allows Beidou to immediately perform the maximum damage of her counterattack if the **Elemental Skill** is used at the precise moment when the character is hit. This lets Beidou tap the **Elemental Skill** to "Perfect Counter" enemy attacks rather than taking multiple attacks over a period of time.
  * **A4** increases Beidou's **Attack Speed** and **Damage** of her **Normal** and **Charged Attacks** by 15% and greatly reduces the delay before unleashing **Charged Attacks** for 10 seconds after using her **Elemental Skill** at its maximum damage.
* **Elemental Burst** creates a lightning discharge which jumps between enemies when your active character deals damage with their **Normal** or **Charged Attacks**. While the **Elemental Burst** is active, **Resistance** to interruption is increased and damage taken is reduced.

## Additional Notes

* Beidou excels an Off-Field DPS, relying on her **Elemental Burst** to provide damage.
* Beidou is often paired with another **Electro** character to help regenerate energy as her **Elemental Burst** has a high energy requirement.
* **Elemental Burst** snapshots buffs on cast, allowing supports such as Bennett to provide a damage increase for the entire duration of the **Elemental Burst.**
* **C2** allows her **Elemental Burst** lightning discharge to bounce between 2 more enemies, greatly increasing her damage.
  * Due to this, Beidou's damage scales with the number of enemies surrounding the active character and decreases by a large amount if only attacking a single target.
* **C6** allows her **Elemental Burst** to reduce the **Electro** **Resistance** of surrounding enemies, making her a Debuffer for **Electro** characters.

## Works Well With

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Keqing.png)

* Beidou primarily acts as a Sub DPS for Keqing, providing extra Off-Field damage with her **Elemental Burst**.
* Beidou can also debuff the the **Electro** **Resistance** of enemies with her **C6** active.
* Keqing's main source of damage being her **Normal** or **Charged Attacks** allows Beidou's **Elemental Burst** to constantly deal **Electro** **Damage**.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Tartaglia.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)

* Childe and Xingqiu provide a high rate of **Hydro** application and combined with Beidou's **Elemental Burst** can constantly create **Electro-Charged** reactions.
* The combination of damage reduction on both Beidou and Xingqiu's **Elemental Bursts** provides increased survivability while both abilities are active.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Eula.png)

* Beidou applies **Electro** for **Superconduct** and her high **Electro** **Damage** can assist Eula against enemies with high **Physical Resistance.**

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Anemo.webp)

* **Anemo** characters pair well with Beidou as they can provide **Elemental Resistance** debuffs with the **Viridescent Venerer** 4-set or other **Elemental Damage** buffs when triggering a **Swirl** reaction.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Sara.png)

* Beidou's ability to snapshot buffs with her **Elemental Burst** allows her to take full advantage of both Bennet and Kujou Sara's **Attack** buffs.
* The **Electro CRIT DMG** increase from Kujou Sara's **C6** can be snapshotted and will last for the entire duration of Beidou's **Elemental Burst**.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Fischl.png)

* Provides additional Off-Field Damage to compliment Beidou and helps generate **Electro Energy Particles** to recharge her **Elemental Burst**.

## Does Not Work Well With

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Cryo.webp)

* Pairing Beidou with most **Cryo** Main DPS will largely lead to triggering **Superconduct**, a reaction which does not increase **Cryo** or **Electro** **Damage**, and will also stop enemies from being **Frozen.**
  * **Physical** Main DPS that use **Cryo** abilities are an exception and can be used with her in order to provide additional Off-Field Damage alongside providing **Superconduct**.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Pyro.webp)

* Against smaller enemies with low Knock-back **Resistance**, the Knock-back of **Overload** can lead to spending too much time chasing them around.
