# Beidou

## Roles

* **Off-Field DPS** (Elemental Burst)
* **Support: **Debuffer (C6), Cleanser (Self Only)

## Character Breakdown

* **Elemental Skill** provides a brief shield based off of her max HP, followed up by a counterattack that scales in both damage and energy generated through either absorbing multiple attacks or activating the skill at the moment where an attack hits you.
  * **A1** increases her **Elemental Skill** damage to its maximum when Beidou blocks an attack the moment it hits her.
* **A4** increases Beidou's attack speed and damage by 15% and greatly reduces her delay for unleashing charge attacks for 10s after using her **Elemental Skill** at its maximum damage.
* **Elemental Burst** creates a lightning arc which jump between enemies when your on-field character deals damage with their **Normal** or **Charged Attacks**, while also providing damage reduction and increased resistance to interruption.

## Additional Notes

* Beidou excels the most as an Off-Field DPS, mainly relying on her **Elemental Burst** to provide damage.
* **C2** allows her **Elemental Burst** lightning arc to bounce between 2 more enemies, greatly increasing her damage potential by up to 66%.
* Beidou's **Elemental Burst** snapshots buffs on cast, allowing supports such as Bennett to provide a damage increase for the entire duration of her **Elemental Burst.**
* Beidou is often paired with another **Electro** character to help regenerate energy as her **Elemental Burst** has a high energy requirement.
* Damage massively depends on there being multiple enemies on field, as the lightning arcs from **Elemental Burst** don't jump on a single enemy, leading to a huge damage loss of 66% (or 80% at **C2**+)
* **C6** allows her **Elemental Burst** to reduce the **Electro** **Resistance** of surrounding enemies, making her a debuffer.

## Works Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Keqing.png)

* Beidou primarily acts as a Sub DPS for Keqing, Providing extra off-field damage with her **Elemental Burst**.
* Beidou can also debuff the the **Electro** **Resistance** of enemies' with her **C6** active.
* Keqing's main source of damage being her **Normal** or **Charged Attacks** allows Beidou's **Elemental Burst** to constantly create lightning arcs.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_tartaglia.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)

* Childe and Xingqiu provide a high rate of **Hydro** application, and combined with Beidou's **Elemental Burst** she can constantly create **Electro-Charged** reactions.
  * The combination of damage reduction on both Beidou and Xingqiu's **Elemental Bursts** provides increased survivability while both are active.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Eula.png)

* Beidou applies **Electro** for **Superconduct** and her high **Electro** damage can assist Eula against enemies with high **Physical Resistance.**

* **Anemo** characters pairs well with Beidou as they provide **Elemental Resistance** debuffs with the **Viridescent Venerer** 4-set when triggering a **Swirl** reaction.
  * Kazuha buffs **Elemental Damage** when triggering a **Swirl** reaction. This **Elemental Damage** buff only applies to characters matching the element Kazuha **Swirls**.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Sara.png)

* Beidou's ability to snapshot buffs with her **Elemental Burst** allows her to take full advantage of both Bennet and Kujou Sara's **Attack** buffs.
  * The** Electro Critical Damage** increase from Kujou Sara's **C6** cannot be snapshot and will last for the entire duration of Beidou's** Elemental Burst**.

* Provides additional Off-Field damage to compliment Beidou and helps generate **Electro Particles** to recharge her **Elemental Burst**.

## Does Not Work Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Cryo.webp)

* Pairing Beidou with most **Cryo** Main DPS will largely lead to triggering **Superconduct**, a reaction which does not increase **Cryo** damage or **Electro** damage.
  * **Physical** Main DPS that use **Cryo** abilities are an exception and can be paired with her.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Pyro.webp)

* Against smaller enemies with low knockback resistance, the knockback of **Overload** can lead to spending too much time chasing them around.

* Beidou is typically used as an Off-Field DPS in these teams with an on-field character such as Keqing or Childe to trigger her **Elemental Burst's** lightning arc.
* A second **Electro** character is recommended to help recharge Beidou's **Elemental Burst**.
* Last character slot is flexible and any character that can be used to provide extra damage or an **Anemo** character with **Viridescent Venerer **4-set.

* Beidou's high Off-Field DPS makes this team work well against large or heavy enemies who can't get knocked back by **Overload**.
* A second **Electro** character is recommended to help recharge Beidou's **Elemental Burst** and create more **Overload** reactions.
* Yoimiya's attack range can help negate some of the downsides of **Overload's** Knockback.
