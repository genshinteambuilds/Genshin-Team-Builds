# Beidou

## Roles

* Sub DPS \(Burst\)

##  Character Breakdown

* Her Elemental Skill Absorbs damage that scales off based on her Max HP and has levels of damage depending on the number of times hit or by perfectly parrying the enemy.
* Beidou's Elemental Burst is her most important ability, after doing a normal or charged attack, deals a lightning discharge that jumps between enemies. 

## Additional Notes

* She excels the most at being a Sub=dps.
* To perfect parry with her E, within 20frames on the cast you want to get hit.
* C2 is her best constellation as its a 66% damage increase on just her Q.
* Her Q snapshots so make sure to get buffs before casting her Q as they won’t apply after. 

## Works Well With

* Arguably Keqing’s best subdps due to her being electro and making it easier to generate particles for her.

* Usually used for “Fireworks” comp where you keep proccing Electro-Charged.

* Same case with childe, to keep proccing Electro-Charged and they both work together well as subdps.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_eula.png)

* Beidou applies electro for superconduct and her Electro damage can make up for the physical damage Eula does against physical resistant enemies.

* Typically used in a “Taser Comp” where Xingqiu and Fischl attack with Beidou and Sucrose just keeps swirling the enemies.
* Kazuha buffs Beidou and the team’s damage with his elemental dmg buff and Viridescent Venerer \(4\).

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_bennett.png) 

* Due to how Beidou Q snapshots, you can cast her Q around the middle of the duration of Bennett Q to make full use of the buff for the team.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_fischl.png) 

* Helps deal electro damage with Beidou and helps generate particles for her due to her high burst energy cost.

## Does Not Work Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_ganyu.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_ayaka.png) 

* Ganyu and Ayaka both don't synergize well with Beidou since they're both cryo DPS, meaning superconduct would be not as beneficial as to physical or electro charged team comps.

* Overload can be a problem against enemies that can be knock backed as you might waste too much time chasing after the enemies.

[Electro-Charged](../../teams/electro-charged.md)

* Beidou's burst offers a lot of off field dps that these comps can take advantage due to their attack patters and their AoE damage.

[Physical](../../teams/physical.md)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_eula.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_fischl.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_beidou.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_diona.png) 

* Beidou provides off field electro damage for Eula to superconduct and decrease enemies physical res.

[Overload](../../teams/overload.md)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_bennett.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_beidou.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_fischl.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_xingqiu.png)

* Beidou's high off field dps makes this team comp work especially with big or heavy enemies that can't get blown away with the reaction.
