# Traveler (Electro)

## Roles

* **Off-Field DPS** (Elemental Burst)
* **Support**: Energy Battery

## Character Breakdown

* Electro Traveler serves as an Energy battery with their Elemental Skill and Burst both providing energy to an on-field character.
* Elemental Skill launches 3 thunder shadows in a cone, dealing damage and creating up to 3 Abundance Amulets when hitting enemies.
  * Abundance Amulets are absorbed a character walks close to them, granting that character energy and increased energy recharge for a short duration.
* Elemental Burst deals initial damage upon activation and then calls down lightning when the character on-field uses Normal or Charged Attacks.
  * The character who triggers the continuous lightning gains a small amount of energy.

## Additional Notes

* The majority of Electro Traveler's constellations and talents focus on further enhancing their energy generating abilities, making them a powerful battery for energy hungry characters.
* C2 provides a modest amount of Electro resistance shred, enhancing both their and other Electro characters damage.
* C6 greatly increases the damage of their Elemental Burst, allowing them to function as an Off-Field Sub DPS.

## Works Well With

* Traveler can provide Eula with constant Superconduct as well as help fund her high cost Elemental Burst.

* Traveler's high Electro application on Normal and Charged Attacks can combine with Tartaglia's high Hydro application from the same source to frequent.

* Electro Traveler provides Razor with a consistent source of energy generation, allowing him to use his Elemental Burst much more frequently.
* Razor's tendency to spend large amounts of time on field doesn't interrupt Traveler, as they require very little time on field to activate their abilities.

## Does Not Work Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Hutao.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Diluc.png)

* Overload can be a burden for close range DPS, as its knockback effect wastes time chasing smaller enemies around.
* Many Pyro DPS are better suited to use reactions other than Overload, which Electro Traveler can interfere with.
* Neither Diluc nor Hu Tao require large amounts of energy, making large parts of Electro Traveler's kit useless.

* This team composition utilizes both Hydro and Electro characters who individually provide strong personal damage coupled with high energy generation from Electro resonance and Electro Traveler, providing high sustained area damage.
* Electro Traveler can funnel energy onto Beidou and Xingqiu to help maintain their Elemental Bursts.

****[**Physical**](../../teams/physical.md)****

* Electro Traveler combines well with Physical characters, giving consistent Electro damage for Superconduct while taking up very little field time.
* Electro Traveler's high energy generation can help support characters such as Eula, who rely on their Elemental Bursts for large portions of their damage.
