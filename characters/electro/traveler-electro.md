# Traveler \(Electro\)

## Roles

* **Off-Field DPS** \(Elemental Burst\)
* **Support:** Energy Battery

## Character Breakdown

* Electro Traveler serves as an Energy battery with their Elemental Skill, as well as a substantial sub DPS with their Elemental Skill and Burst.
* Elemental Skill discharges 3 Thunder Shadows and additionally conjures up to 3 Abundance Amulets with Constellation 1
  * Each Amulet both increases Elemental Recharge as well as provides Elemental Energy when absorbed by the nearby character
* Elemental Burst has an initial attack dealing Electro Damage, followed by a continuous Lightning Shroud, which will deal sustained Electro Damage with Falling Thunder
  * Falling Thunder is activated through Normal and Charged Attacks, and will generate Elemental Energy for the Character for each proc.

## Additional Notes

* Electro Traveler's passives grant reduced Elemental Skill cooldown when the Abundance Amulets are absorbed, as well as increasing their Energy Recharge by 10% of Electro Traveler's Recharge 
* Constellation 2 and Constellation 6 improve the Elemental Burst by decreasing opponents Electro Resistance, as well as granting additional Energy for Falling Thunder procs.
* Constellation 4 increases the Elemental Energy gained by the Abundance Amulets by 100% when the active character's Energy level is below 35%

## Works Well With

* Eula can benefit from the high Superconduct uptime and extra damage provided by Electro Traveler.

* Tartaglia can apply Electro-Charged very frequently with Electro Traveler for a boost to your sustained and area damage.

* Electro Traveler provides Razor with a consistent source of energy generation, allowing him to use his burst much more frequently. Razor is also a character that wants to be the active character most of the time, and Electro Traveler does not need to be switched in very often and for very long to perform her job.

## Does Not Work Well With

* Electro Travelerâ€™s constant Electro application can fling enemies out of your DPS when used with someone like Hu Tao or Diluc due to Overload's knockback effect. They can also interfere with the consistency of vaporize reactions which can lower the total amount of damage being dealt.
