# Traveler (Electro)

## Roles

* **Off-Field DPS** (Elemental Burst)
* **Support**: Energy Battery
* **Sub DPS** (C6)

## Character Breakdown

* **Elemental Skill** launches 3 thunder shadows in a cone, dealing damage and creating up to 3 **Abundance Amulets** when hitting enemies.
  * **Abundance Amulets** are absorbed when a character walks close to them, granting that character energy and increased **Energy Recharge** for a short duration.
* **Elemental Burst** deals initial damage upon activation and then calls down lightning when the character on-field uses **Normal** or **Charged Attacks**.
  * The character who triggers the lightning gains a small amount of energy.

## Additional Notes

* Traveler (Electro) serves as an Energy Battery, as their **Elemental Skill** and **Elemental Burst** both provide energy to an on-field character.
* The majority of Traveler's (Electro) **Constellations** and **Talents** focus on further enhancing their energy-generating abilities, making them a powerful Energy Battery for characters with high-cost **Elemental Bursts**.
* **C2** provides an **Electro Resistance** debuff, enhancing both their and other **Electro** characters' damage.
* **C6** greatly increases the damage of their **Elemental Burst**, allowing them to function as an Off-Field Sub DPS.

## Works Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Eula.png)

* Traveler (Electro) can provide Eula with **Superconduct**, which debuffs **Physical Resistance**, as well as help recharge her high-cost **Elemental Burst**.

* Traveler's (Electro) high **Electro** application can enable constant **Electro-Charged** reactions with Childe's **Elemental Skill** and can help recharge his **Elemental Burst** faster.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Razor.png)

* Traveler (Electro) provides Razor with a consistent source of energy generation, allowing him to use his **Elemental Burst** much more frequently.
* Razor's tendency to spend large amounts of time on field doesn't interrupt Traveler, as they require very little time on field to activate their abilities.

## Does Not Work Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Hutao.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Diluc.png)

* **Overload** can be a burden for close-range DPS, as its knockback effect wastes time chasing smaller enemies around.
* Many **Pyro** DPS are better suited to use reactions other than **Overload**, which Traveler (Electro) can interfere with.
* Neither Diluc nor Hu Tao requires large amounts of energy, making large parts of Electro Traveler's kit useless.

****[**Electro-Charged (Hydro)**](../../teams/electro-charged-hydro.md)****

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Tartaglia.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Beidou.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_aether\_electro.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)

* This team utilizes both **Hydro** and **Electro** characters who provide strong individual damage coupled with high energy generation from **Electro Resonance** and **Electro-Charged** reactions, resulting in good sustained area damage.
* Traveler (Electro) can provide energy for Beidou and Xingqiu to help maintain their **Elemental Bursts**.

****[**Physical (Cryo)**](../../teams/physical.md)****

* Traveler (Electro) synergizes well with **Physical** characters by providing consistent **Electro** damage for **Superconduct** reactions while taking up very little field time.
* Electro Traveler's high energy generation can help support characters such as Eula, who rely on their **Elemental Bursts** for large portions of their damage.
