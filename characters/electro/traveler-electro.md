# Traveler (Electro)

## Roles

* **Off-Field DPS** (Elemental Burst)
* **Support**: Energy Battery
* **Sub DPS** (C6)

## Character Breakdown

* **Elemental Skill** launches 3 thunder shadows in a cone, dealing **Electro DMG** and creating up to 3 Abundance Amulets when hitting enemies.
  * Abundance Amulets are absorbed when a character walks close to them, granting that character energy and increased **Energy Recharge** for a short duration.
* **Elemental Burst** deals **Electro DMG** upon activation and then calls down lightning when the character On-Field uses **Normal** or **Charged Attacks**.
  * The character who triggers the lightning gains a small amount of energy.

## Additional Notes

* Traveler (Electro) serves as an Energy Battery, as their **Elemental Skill** and **Elemental Burst** can both provide energy to other characters on the team.
* The majority of Traveler's **Constellations** and **Talents** focus on further enhancing their energy-generating abilities, making them a powerful Energy Battery for characters with high-cost **Elemental Bursts**.
* **C2** causes Traveler's **Elemental Burst** to debuff the enemy's **Electro Resistance**.

## Works Well With

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Eula.png)

* Traveler (Electro) can provide Eula with **Superconduct**, which debuffs **Physical Resistance**, as well as help recharge her high-cost **Elemental Burst**.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Tartaglia.png)

* Traveler (Electro) applies **Electro** regularly and can enable constant **Electro-Charged** reactions with Childe's **Elemental Skill** as well as help recharge his **Elemental Burst** faster.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Razor.png)

* Traveler (Electro) provides Razor with a consistent source of energy generation, allowing him to use his **Elemental Burst** much more frequently.
* Razor's tendency to spend large amounts of time On-Field doesn't interrupt Traveler, as they require very little time to activate their abilities.

## Does Not Work Well With

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Hutao.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Diluc.png)

* **Overload** can be a burden for close-range DPS, as its Knock-back effect wastes time chasing smaller enemies around.
* Many **Pyro** DPS are better suited to use reactions other than **Overload**, which Traveler (Electro) can interfere with.
* Neither Diluc nor Hu Tao requires large amounts of energy, making large parts of Electro Traveler's kit useless.

* Traveler (Electro) synergizes well with **Physical** characters by providing consistent **Electro** **DMG** for **Superconduct** reactions while taking up very little field time.
* Traveler's energy generation can help support characters such as Eula, who rely heavily on their **Elemental Bursts**.
