# Shinobu

## Roles

* **Support:** Healer

## **Character Breakdown**

* **Elemental Skill** creates a Grass Ring of Sanctification that follows your active character. The ring deals **Electro DMG** to nearby enemies every 1.5s and heals the active character based on Shinobu's **Max HP**.
* **Elemental Burst** deals continuous **AoE Electro DMG** to enemies within a field that scales from Shinobu's **Max HP**.
  * This field will last longer if Shinobu's HP is less than or equal to 50% when the **Elemental Burst** is activated.&#x20;
* **A1** increases her **Healing Bonus** by 15% when her HP is less than or equal to 50%
* **A4** improves her **Elemental Skill** ability by increasing the healing amount by 75% of her **Elemental Mastery** and **Electro DMG** dealt by 25% of her **Elemental Mastery**.

## Additional Notes

* **C4** will apply a Thundergrass Mark to enemies affected by Shinobu's Grass Ring of Sanctification and hit by the active character's **Normal**, **Charged**, or **Plunging Attack**. The Mark will deal **AoE Electro DMG** based on 9.7% of Shinobu's **Max HP**.
* **C6** allows Shinobu to survive taking lethal **DMG**, leaving her on 1 HP and this effect will trigger once every 60s
* **C6** increases Shinobu's **Elemental Mastery** by 150 for 15s when her HP drops below 25%. This effect will trigger every 60s.&#x20;

* Shinobu can work in almost any team in the game as a universal Healer.
* It is recommended to pair her with **Hydro** and **Anemo** characters so she can also be utilized to apply **Electro-Charged** reactions.&#x20;
* You can also fit her into a Mono-Geo team to allow her to proc **Crystalized** reactions from off-field whilst healing the active character.

* Shinobu's focus on healing reduces her synergy with other Healers and Shielders, who often fill the same role, reducing Shinobu's utility.

* Shinobu's utility as both a healer and **Electro**-applier allows her to be used in a double-**Hydro** composition that allows the use of an **Anemo** support to boost the team's overall **DPS**.

#### [Electro-Charged (Electro)](../../teams/electro-charged.md)

* Allows for more healing potential in a taser team which makes this team composition safer to run than with another **Electro** character such as Beidou.
