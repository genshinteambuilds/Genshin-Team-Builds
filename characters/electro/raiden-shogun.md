# Raiden

## **Roles**

* **Burst DPS**
* **Off-Field DPS** (Elemental Skill)
* **Support:** Energy Battery, Buffer (C4)

## **Character Breakdown**

* With the Raiden Shogun in your party, casting **Elemental Bursts** from other party members will grant her **Resolve** (Max 60 stacks) based on the cost of the **Elemental Burst** used. **Resolve** increases her own **Elemental Burst's** damage.
* **A1** grants 2 stacks of **Resolve** when a character collects an elemental particle, can occur once every 3 seconds.
* **Elemental Skill **deals **Electro** damage on use and causes a coordinated attack to be launched whenever an active character deals damage to an enemy, dealing AoE **Electro** damage (with a short cooldown of 0.9s).
  * It also raises their **Elemental Burst** damage relative to the total **Energy Cost** of the active character's **Elemental Burst**.
* **Elemental Burst** consumes all **Resolve** stacks gained and causes the Raiden Shogun to deal massive AoE **Electro** damage in the direction she is facing. Following the initial burst, she then converts her** Normal **and** Charged Attacks** to **Electro** which counts as **Elemental Burst **Damage for 7 seconds.&#x20;
  * The Raiden Shogun’s attacks during her **Elemental Burst** generate energy for the rest of the party.
* **A4** causes **Energy Recharge** to increase the Raiden Shogun’s **Electro** damage by 0.4% as well as increase the **Energy Recharge** for the party from her **Elemental Burst** by 0.6% for every 1% above 100% Energy Recharge.

## **Additional Notes**

* **Elemental Skill** will not launch a coordinated attack against enemies protected by certain shields, such as Abyss Mages.
* **Elemental Burst** can only provide energy to the team 5 times, with a 1 second cooldown between activations.
* **C2** massively increases Raiden Shogun's **Elemental Burst** damage making her a strong Main DPS option when building a team.
* The Raiden Shogun can't cook.

## **Works Well With**

****![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Sara.png)

* Kujou Sara is one of the Raiden Shogun’s best supports in her team, providing extra energy generation both from her own **Elemental Skill** as well as activating **Electro Resonance. **Her **Attack** boost can increase the Raiden Shogun’s **Elemental Burst** damage during its duration.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Eula.png)

* Eula is naturally a very strong Main DPS to pair with Raiden Shogun due to the fact that Raiden Shogun provides consistent **Superconduct** reaction from off-field while also increasing Eula’s **Elemental Burst **damage which she is generally very reliant on. The Raiden Shogun’s energy generation can also assist recharging Eula’s own **Elemental Burst.**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_aether\_electro.png)

* Traveler (Electro) can also fulfill a similar role to Kujou Sara, generating energy with their **Elemental Skill** and debuffing enemies' **Electro Resistance** for a DPS boost.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xiangling.png)

* Xiangling is a character who's damage is mainly focused on her **Elemental Burst** and struggles with energy generation, on top of this Raiden Shogun can deal damage with her **Elemental Burst** alongside Xiangling's** Elemental Burst.** This makes the Raiden Shogun a solid pairing with her.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)

* Bennett's **Elemental Burst** synergizes well with Raiden Shogun's **Elemental Burst**, providing her with large amounts of **Attack** during her damage window. Although Bennett does not have energy issues, he can be a** Pyro** Energy Battery for another unit along with Raiden Shogun, like Xiangling.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)

* Xingqiu's **Elemental Burst** can be triggered by Raiden Shogun's **Normal Attacks** in her **Elemental Burst**. Along with the damage reduction, small amounts of healing, and an** Elemental Burst **costing 80 energy which grants Raiden Shogun with more Resolve stacks, Xingqiu is able to provide a strong mix of offensive damage and defensive utility while also benefiting from the energy Raiden Shogun can generate.

## **Does Not Work Well With**

****![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Beidou.png)****

* Beidou's **Elemental Burst** cannot be triggered by Raiden Shogun's **Normal Attacks** in her **Elemental Burst**, making Beidou lose her usefulness in providing powerful off-field damage.
  * A Beidou pairing can be utilized somewhat by staggering the **Elemental Burst** rotations such that Raiden uses her **Elemental Burst** before and after Beidou's **Elemental Burst** duration is over.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Diluc.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Hutao.png)

* Diluc and Hu Tao's damage is mainly focused on their **Normal **and** Charged Attacks** and generally doesn’t need much extra energy generation thanks to their low-cost **Elemental Bursts**, in addition to this, Raiden Shogun will cause their attacks to **Overload** and ruin stronger reaction options such as **Melt** and **Vaporize**.

* A variation of the popular "National" team composition. This team setup utilizes the powerful off-field high **Energy Cost** **Elemental Bursts** of Xiangling and Xingqui to stack **Resolve** onto Raiden Shogun for high team damage during all active** Elemental Bursts**.
* Bennett provides healing and and **Attack** buff to Raiden Shogun and Xiangling.
