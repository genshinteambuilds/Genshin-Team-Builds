# Raiden Shogun

## **Roles**

* Burst DPS
* Sub DPS
* Support

## **Character Breakdown**

* Raiden Shogun is a multipurpose character who can provide off-field damage, consistent DPS, Burst Damage and party buffs.
* With the Raiden Shogun in your party, casting Elemental Bursts from other party members will grant her Resolve based on the cost of the Burst used. Resolve increases her own Elemental Burst damage
* Elemental Skill unveils a shard of her Euthymia, which causes a coordinated attack to be launched whenever an active party member deals damage to an enemy that deals AoE Electro Damage \(with a short cooldown of 0.9s\). In addition to this, it grants active characters the Eye of Stormy Judgement, which raises their Elemental Burst DMG% relative to the total Energy cost of the Burst.
* Elemental Burst consumes all Resolve and causes the Raiden Shogun to deal massive AoE Electro Damage in the direction she is facing. Following the initial burst, she then converts her attacks to Electro which also counts as Elemental Burst DMG for 7 seconds. The Raiden Shogun’s attacks during her Elemental Burst generate Energy for the rest of the party.
* Energy Recharge will increase the Raiden Shogun’s Electro DMG as well as the Energy Generated for the party from her Elemental Burst

## **Additional Notes**

* Raiden Shogun’s Elemental skill will not launch a coordinated attack against enemies protected by certain shields, such as Abyss Mages.
* The Energy generated for the party from the Raiden Shogun’s Elemental Burst can only be applied 5 times, with a 1 second cooldown between activations.
* The Raiden Shogun can't cook.

## **Works Well With**

 ****![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_sara.png) 

* Kujou Sara is one of the Raiden Shogun’s best partners in a team, she provides extra Energy generation both from her own Elemental Skill as well as providing Electro Resonance and her ATK boost can bolster the Raiden Shogun’s Elemental Burst DPS window.

* Eula is naturally a very strong Main DPS to pair with Raiden due to the fact that Raiden Shogun provides consistent Superconduct off-field while also bolstering Eula’s Elemental Burst DMG which she is generally very reliant on. The Raiden Shogun’s extra Energy generation can also assist with Eula’s own Burst upkeep.

* Traveler \(Electro\) can also fulfill a similar role to Kujou Sara, generating Energy with their Abundance Amulets and shredding Electro Resistance for a DPS boost.

* Xiangling is another character who’s very focused on her Elemental Burst and struggles with Energy generation, on top of this her rapid Pyro application can actually cause Overload procs to deal significant DPS, making the Raiden Shogun a solid pairing with her

* Bennett's Elemental Burst synergizes well with Raiden Shogun's Elemental Burst, providing her with large amounts of ATK during her DPS window. Although Bennett does not have energy issues, he can be a Pyro Battery for another unit along with Raiden Shogun like Xiangling.

* Xingqui's Elemental Burst can be procced by Raiden Shogun's Normal Attacks in her Elemental Burst. Along with the Damage Reduction, small amounts of Healing, and 80 Energy cost Elemental Burst, Xingqui is able to provide a strong mix of offensive DPS and defensive utility while also benefiting from the Energy Raiden Shogun can generate. 

## **Does Not Work Well With**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_beidou.png) 

* Beidou's Elemental Burst cannot be procced by Raiden Shogun's Normal Attacks in her Elemental Burst, making Beidou lose her usefulness in providing powerful off-field Damage. 
* Note: a Beidou pairing can be utilized somewhat by staggering the Elemental Burst rotations such that Raiden uses her Elemental Burst before and after Beidou's Elemental Burst duration is over. 

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_diluc.png) 

* Diluc's DPS is not focused on his Burst Damage and generally doesn’t need much extra energy generation thanks to his low-cost Burst, in addition to this, Raiden Shogun will cause Diluc to Overload many of his attacks and ruin stronger reaction options for him such as Melt and Vaporize.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_hutao.png)

* Hu Tao, similarly to Diluc, wants to benefit from Vaporize and Melt much more than transformative reactions like Overload. 

## **Teams**

Raiden National

* A variation of the popular "National" team composition. This setup utilizes the powerful off-field high Energy Cost Elemental Bursts of Xiangling and Xingqui to stack Resolve onto Raiden. Bennett is there to provide Healing and a huge ATK Buff to Raiden Shogun and Xiangling.

* A standard team composition for Raiden Shogun that focuses on utilizing her off-field Electro Damage for consistent Superconduct upkeep as well as increasing the teams Burst Damage and Energy economy.

* A slightly less conventional team that utilizes the Raiden Shogun as your primary DPS and buffing her damage to its limits while feeding the whole team high amounts of Energy. While her Burst damage here is extreme, the main downside to this composition is that your DPS will tank greatly when the Raiden Shogun is not in her Elemental Burst.
* This team composition is much more effective with Raiden Shogun's Constellation 2+.
