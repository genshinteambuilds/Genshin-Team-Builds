# Raiden

## **Roles**

* **Burst DPS**
* **Off-Field DPS** (Elemental Skill)
* **Support:** Energy Battery, Buffer (C4)
* **Main DPS**

## **Character Breakdown**

* With the Raiden Shogun in your party, casting **Elemental Bursts** from other party members will grant her Resolve (Max 60 stacks) based on the energy cost of the **Elemental Burst** used. Resolve increases her own **Elemental Burst's** damage.
  * **A1** grants 2 stacks of Resolve when a character collects an **Energy Particle**, can occur once every 3 seconds.
* **Elemental Skill** deals Electro damage on use and causes a coordinated attack to be launched whenever an active character deals damage to an enemy, dealing **AoE** **Electro** **Damage** (with a short Cooldown of 0.9 seconds).
  * It also raises their **Elemental Burst** damage relative to the total **Energy Cost** of the active character's **Elemental Burst**.
* **Elemental Burst** consumes all Resolve stacks gained and causes the Raiden Shogun to deal massive **AoE** **Electro** **Damage** in the direction she is facing. Following the initial burst, she then converts her **Normal** and **Charged Attacks** to **Electro** which counts as **Elemental Burst** Damage for 7 seconds.
  * The Raiden Shogun’s attacks during her **Elemental Burst** generate energy for the rest of the party.
* **A4** causes **Energy Recharge** to increase the Raiden Shogun’s **Electro** **Damage** by 0.4% as well as increase the **Energy Recharge** for the party from her **Elemental Burst** by 0.6% for every 1% above 100% **Energy Recharge.**

## **Additional Notes**

* **Elemental Skill** will not launch a coordinated attack against enemies protected by certain shields, such as Abyss Mages.
* **Elemental Burst** can only provide energy to the team 5 times, with a 1 second cooldown between activations.
* **C2** massively increases Raiden Shogun's **Elemental Burst** damage making her a strong Main DPS option when building a team.
* The Raiden Shogun can't cook.

## **Works Well With**

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Sara.png)

* Kujou Sara is one of the Raiden Shogun’s best supports in her team, providing extra **Electro Energy Particles** both from her own **Elemental Skill** as well as activating **Electro Resonance.** Her **ATK** boost can increase the Raiden Shogun’s **Elemental Burst** damage during its duration.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Eula.png)

* Eula is naturally a very strong Main DPS to pair with Raiden Shogun due to the fact that Raiden Shogun provides consistent **Superconduct** reaction when Off-Field while also increasing Eula’s **Elemental Burst** damage which she is generally very reliant on. The Raiden Shogun’s energy generation can also assist recharging Eula’s own **Elemental Burst.**

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_aether\_electro.png)

* Traveler (Electro) can also fulfill a similar role to Kujou Sara, providing **Electro Energy Particles** with their **Elemental Skill** but can also debuff enemies' **Electro Resistance** for a damage boost.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xiangling.png)

* Xiangling is a character who's damage is mainly focused on her **Elemental Burst** and struggles with energy generation. The Raiden Shogun can deal damage with her **Elemental Burst** alongside Xiangling's **Elemental Burst** while also recharging it at the same time.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)

* Bennett's **Elemental Burst** synergizes well with Raiden Shogun's **Elemental Burst**, providing her with large amounts of **ATK** during her **Elemental Burst**. Although Bennett does not have energy issues, he can be a **Pyro** Energy Battery for another unit along with Raiden Shogun, like Xiangling.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)

* Xingqiu's **Elemental Burst** can be triggered by Raiden Shogun's **Normal Attacks** in her **Elemental Burst**. Along with the damage reduction, small amounts of healing, and an **Elemental Burst** costing 80 energy which grants Raiden Shogun with more Resolve stacks, Xingqiu is able to provide a strong mix of offensive damage and defensive utility while also benefiting from the energy Raiden Shogun can generate.

## **Does Not Work Well With**

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Beidou.png)

* Beidou's **Elemental Burst** cannot be triggered by Raiden Shogun's **Normal Attacks** in her **Elemental Burst**, making Beidou lose her usefulness in providing powerful Off-Field damage.
  * A Beidou pairing can be utilized somewhat by staggering the **Elemental Burst** rotations such that Raiden uses her **Elemental Burst** before and after Beidou's **Elemental Burst** duration is over although this results in quite a long DPS rotation.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Diluc.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Hutao.png)

* Diluc and Hu Tao's damage is mainly focused on their **Normal** and **Charged Attacks** and generally doesn’t need much extra energy generation thanks to their low-cost **Elemental Bursts**, in addition to this, Raiden Shogun will cause their attacks to **Overload** and ruin stronger **Elemental Reactions** such as **Melt** and **Vaporize**.

* A variation of the popular "National" team composition. This team setup utilizes the powerful off-field high **Energy Cost** **Elemental Bursts** of Xiangling and Xingqui to stack **Resolve** onto Raiden Shogun for high team damage during all active **Elemental Bursts**.
* Raiden Shogun additionally allows **Energy Recharge** requirements across the team to be lower.

[**Oneshot**](../../teams/oneshot.md)

* This team that utilizes the Raiden Shogun as the Main DPS and focuses on buffing her **Elemental Burst** damage while feeding the whole team high amounts of energy. For a detailed look at how this team works, check out the [**Oneshot**](../../teams/oneshot.md) page.
* Sara provides an **ATK** buff, as well as **Electro Energy Particle** generation for Raiden Shogun. She can also provide a **CRIT DMG** Buff with **C6**.
* Kazuha buffs Raiden Shogun's **Elemental Burst** even further by debuffing **Electro Resistance** with the **Viridescent Venerer** 4-set, as well as buffing **Elemental Damage**.
* Bennett acts as the team's healer while providing an **ATK** Buff from his **Elemental Burst**.
* This team is much more effective with Raiden Shogun's **C2** and Kujou Sara's **C6**.

[**Physical (Cryo)**](../../teams/physical-cryo.md)

* A standard team for Raiden Shogun that focuses on utilizing her Off-Field **Electro** **Damage** for consistent **Superconduct** reactions to reduce **Physical Resistance** as well as increasing the team's **Elemental Burst** damage and energy economy.
