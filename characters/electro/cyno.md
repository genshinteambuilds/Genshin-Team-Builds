# Cyno

## Roles

* **On-Field DPS** (selfish)

## Character Breakdown

* **Elemental Skill** deals **Electro DMG** in front.&#x20;
* **Elemental Burst** infuses Cyno’s **Normal**, **Charge**, **Plunge Attacks** with **Electro DMG**, gives 100 **Elemental Mastery** and resistance to interruption as well as immunity to **Electro-Charged DMG**.&#x20;
  * Causes **Elemental Skill** to do **AoE Electro DMG** and extends **Elemental Burst** duration to a maximum of 18 second.&#x20;
  * Unlike most infusion based characters, Cyno’s **Normal**, **Charge**, **Plunge Attacks** during his **Elemental Burst** duration are not scaled based on his **Normal Attack** talent but his **Elemental Burst** instead.&#x20;

## Additional Notes

* **A1** increases **Elemental Skill DMG** and does additional **Electro DMG** in the form of Duststalker Bolt.&#x20;
* **A4** increases **Normal Attacks DMG** and Duststalker Bolt **DMG** based on Cyno’s **Elemental Mastery**.
* There is a visual indicator during the **Elemental Burst** that cues the player to use his **Elemental Skill**.&#x20;
* Extending Cyno’s **Elemental Burst** duration to the full 18 seconds is NOT recommended. A good estimate would be 14 seconds so that other units in the team can maximize their impacts.

## Works Well With

## ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_nahida.png)

* The **Elemental Mastery** on Cyno sits perfectly with the Aggravate reaction. Nahida is a dendro unit that allows Cyno to have access to said reaction with her long skill duration.&#x20;
* Nahida also provides **Elemental Mastery** to the team via her **Elemental Burst** which Cyno will benefit from.

* Fischl's **Elemental Skill** provides good energy over a long time for the team, lowering **Energy Recharge** requirements for more offensive stats as well as doing considerable damage herself.

* Cyno will be on field for an extended amount of time, meaning that he would get hit more often. Zhongli's shield blocks a large amount of damage from enemies and prevents interruption, allowing Cyno to focus more on dealing damage rather than dodging but more importantly to consistently use his **Elemental Skill** when prompted. The shield also reduces all enemy **RES**.

## Does Not Work Well With

* Cyno does not benefit from Superconduct nor does he need to extend the Dendro aura through Cryo using an interaction called “Fridging”.

* Depending on how fast hydro is applied to the enemy, the rate of seeds creation vs Quicken uptime will shift more to one side or the other. Slower hydro application will allow full Quicken uptime (Quickbloom) but less seeds and vice versa.
