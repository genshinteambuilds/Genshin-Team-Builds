# Razor

## Roles

* **Main DPS**

## Character Breakdown

* Normal Attacks are the most vital part of Razor's kit, and he heavily relies on dealing Physical damage.
* Elemental Skill changes based on whether it is tapped or held. 
  * On tap, he deals AOE Electro damage and gains an Electro Sigil \(of which he can hold a maximum of 3\). Each Sigil increases his Energy Recharge. 
  * On hold, he deals Electro damage in a circle around him and converts all of his electro sigils into energy.
* Elemental Burst deals an instance of AoE Electro damage around him and consumes all his Sigils, which then grant him energy. He gains the following effects:
  * Electro damage is dealt alongside each attack
  * Attack Speed increased
  * Charge Attack disabled
  * Increased resistance to interruption
  * Cannot take damage from the Electro-Charged status and has increased Electro Resistance
* At A1, the cooldown on Razor's Elemental Skill is reduced, and activating his Elemental Burst instantly resets the cooldown of his Elemental Skill. 
* At A4, Razor gains extra Energy Recharge when he has less than half of the energy needed for his Elemental Burst.

## Additional Notes

* When his Elemental Burst is not active, Razor deals more damage per second with a three-hit combo followed by a dash cancel to omit the final attack; however, if Razor's Elemental Burst is active he will deal more damage with a full four-hit combo \(dash canceling after the fourth hit\) instead.
* Swapping to another character while Razor's Elemental Burst is active will prematurely end it. It is therefore generally recommended to keep him on the field for as long as possible.
  * An exception to this is when all enemies are dead. Prematurely canceling his Elemental Burst will return a small amount of energy to Razor. 
* Razor's passive reduces sprinting's stamina consumption by 20% partywide \(non-stackable with other effects\). This makes Razor a good world exploration character, as his claymore can also mine ores.

## Works Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/element_cryo.webp) 

* Superconduct is Razor’s core reaction, as it lowers enemy resistance to physical damage. Thus, most Cryo characters are generally very effective.

* Xingqiu can heal, reduce damage, and increase Razor’s resistance to interruption, making him an extremely good Sub-DPS for Razor.
* Barbara can heal Off-Field, making her a decent pair for Razor since he benefits the most from Off-Field effects.
* Hydro characters will not disrupt Superconduct reactions.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_beidou.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_fischl.png) 

* Beidou’s Elemental Burst deals high amounts of Off-Field Electro damage and gives Razor damage reduction and resistance to interruption. Note that Beidou requires investment into Energy Recharge.
* Fischl provides energy for Razor and deals Off-Field Electro damage. 
* Both characters provide Electro Resonance, which can help with Razor's Elemental Burst uptime.

 

* Most Anemo characters can crowd control and group enemies, allowing for Razor to hit multiple enemies more easily.

* Zhongli's shield allows Razor to negate incoming damage that might otherwise stagger him and also reduces enemy physical resistance. His Elemental Burst locks enemies in place, preventing them from being knocked back by Razor's attacks.
* Albedo provides Off-Field damage and can generate Crystallize shields.

## **Does Not Work Well With**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_chongyun.png) 

* Razor's kit innately favors Physical damage. Chongyun's Elemental Skill converts Razor's Normal Attacks to Cryo damage, which negates his build's Physical damage bonuses.

* Overload reactions will knock smaller enemies away from Razor. However, Pyro can be used on larger enemies for additional damage.

[Physical](../../teams/physical.md)

Superconduct

  ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_razor.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_kaeya.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_diona.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_fischl.png)   


* A team that runs Razor as Main Dps and Cryo supports to cause Superconduct.
* Two Cryo characters are often run to act as Energy Batteries for one another.
* The last slot can be any utility or damaging character.

Non-Superconduct  

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_razor.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_xingqiu.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_beidou.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_zhongli.png) 

* Building a non-Superconduct team is possible, but not highly recommended as it takes away priority support options from other teams.
* Strong Sub-DPS and/or Geo or Pyro resonances are used here to boost the team's damage.
