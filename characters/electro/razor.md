# Razor

## Roles

* Main DPS

## Character Breakdown

* For Razor, Physical damage is his main form of damage.
* His standard AA \(Auto Attacks\) are the most vital parts of his kit, as he relies on dealing physical damage the most.
* His E \(Elemental Skill, Claw and Thunder\), changes based on whether you tap or hold it. On tapping, Razor strikes an attack with a claw that deals AOE Electro damage, giving him an electro sigil \(to a max of 3\) that increases his ER \(Energy Recharge\) by 20% each. On holding, he deals Electro damage in a circle around him and consumes any electro sigils he has for additional energy for his Elemental Burst.
* His Q \(Elemental Burst, Lightning Fang\), deals AOE Electro damage around him and consumes all his sigils \(which grant him even more energy\). It also gives him % Electro damage alongside each attack, and boosts his AA speed by 26-40%, allowing him to dish out even more physical damage, which is extremely useful.
* His first passive \(Awakening\), reduces the cooldown of his E by 18%, and activating his Q instantly resets the cooldown of his E. This means that he can use his E much more to generate more energy for his Q.
* His second passive \(Hunger\), Gives him an extra 30% ER when he is under 50% energy on his Q, which essentially allows him to generate energy faster for his Q.
* Overall, he relies on his E to generate energy as quickly as possible to activate his Q for constant physical damage.

## Additional Notes

* Elemental Burst gives him additional Electro damage, Electro RES bonus, immunity against Electro-charged, and resistance to interruption
* Without his Q \(Elemental Burst, Lightning Fang\) active, he does more damage with a 3 hit combo and dash cancelling the final attack. However with Q, he does more damage with the full 4 hit combo \(with dash cancelling\) instead.
* It should be noted that when his Q is active, swapping to another character would prematurely end it, so it is highly recommended to keep him on the field for long periods of time.
* His passive \(Wolvensprint\), reduces stamina consumption by 20% while sprinting partywide. \(It is non-stackable with other effects however\)

## Works Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/element_cryo.webp) 

* Superconductor is Razor’s core reaction, as it lowers enemy defences to physical damage, thus most cryo characters are generally very effective.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_xingqiu.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_barbara.png) 

* Xingqiu’s Elemental Skill and Burst helps to heal, reduce damage, and increase Razor’s resistance to interruption, making him an extremely good SubDps for Razor.
* Barbara’s Elemental Skill heals Razor and cleanses pyro debuffs periodically, making her a good pair for him since he benefits the most from off-field effects.
* Both provide off-field support, making them great additions to the team, they do not get in the way of superconduct reactions as well.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_beidou.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_fischl.png) 

* Beidou’s Elemental Burst deals high amounts of electro damage while being off field, and gives Razor more survivability due to damage reduction and resistance to interruption. Just note that Beidou requires quite a bit of energy recharge as her Burst costs 80 energy.
* Fischl provides energy for Razor and provides more off field electro damage. 
* As Electro resonance is active when using either, it gives Razor even more ability to recharge his ult, keeping it active in prolonged fights.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_bennett.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_xiangling.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_xinyan.png) 

* What support guide can I write without mentioning Bennett amirite?
* His Elemental Burst can cleanse, heal and buff ATK, he has a lot of energy recharge to regain his burst as well, making him a solid choice.
* Xiangling works as an off-field damage dealer for Razor, making her a heavy damaging SubDPS with good investment.
* Xinyan provides a shield that gives Razor a 15% Physical damage boost while shielded.
* Only issue is that they apply Pyro, which makes Overload reactions very likely to happen, forcing Razor to chase after the knockback enemies.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%281%29.png) 

* You crowd control them into an area for Razor to hit them, pretty simple.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_zhongli.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_albedo.png) 

* Zhongli has the best shield for off-field protection, and reduces enemy physical resistance by 20%, additionally his burst petrifies enemies for Razor to hit them.
* Albedo provides a bit of additional damage, and the occasional shield that can be used, solid pick for Razor as well

## **Does Not Work Well With**

\*\*\*\*![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_jean.png) ****

* Jean needs to be swapped to on the field to activate her Elemental Skill and Burst, making it hard to work with Razor as he prefers to be on field for long periods.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_eula.png) 

* As a physical damage dealer himself, he does not work with other physical damage carriers like Eula.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_chongyun.png) 

* Chonyun’s Elemental Skill infuses weapons with Cryo, Razor is not meant to deal cryo damage, using Razor while Chongyun’s Skill is on the field would severely cripple Razor’s damage, avoid using him at all.

[Physical](../../teams/physical.md)

  ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_razor.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_kaeya.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_diona.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_fischl.png)   


* Kaeya helps to create superconduct reactions with his Skill and Elemental Burst, Diona helps to heal and shield Razor against attacks, last slot is a flex slot based on your needs.
* Overall this team works on activating superconduct reactions to deal lots of physical damage with Razor.
* Kaeya can be replaced with another Cryo application character and Diona with another healer to keep Razor alive.

Non-Superconduct  

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_razor.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_xingqiu.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_xinyan.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_zhongli.png) 

* Alternate team composition you can try if you do not want to build a superconduct based team
* Zhongli for the shield and debuff, Xinyan for the bonus physical damage and Xingqiu for electrocharge reaction and additional damage from his Burst.
* Though this works \(and replaceable with other chars\), I’d still recommend using a superconduct based team as it’s more useful in bringing out Razor’s physical damage.
