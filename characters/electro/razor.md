# Razor

## Roles

* **Main DPS** (Selfish)

## Character Breakdown

* **Normal Attacks** are the most important part of Razor's kit, as they are his primary source of damage.
* **Elemental Skill (Tap)** makes Razor deal **Electro** **DMG** and gains an **Electro** Sigil (of which he can hold a maximum of 3). Each Sigil increases his **Energy Recharge**.
* **Elemental Skill (Hold)** makes Razor deal **Electro** **DMG** in an **AoE** and converts all of his **Electro** Sigils into energy.
* **Elemental Burst** deals an instance of **Electro** **DMG** in an **AoE** and consumes all his **Electro** Sigils, which then grant him energy. He gains the following effects for the skill's duration:
  * Each attack deals additional **Electro** **DMG**.
  * **ATK SPD** increased.
  * **Charged Attack** disabled.
  * Increased resistance to interruption.
  * Razor becomes immune to the **Electro-Charged** **Elemental Reaction** and has increased **Electro** **RES**.
* **A1** reduces the Cooldown on Razor's **Elemental Skill**, and activating his **Elemental Burst** instantly resets the Cooldown of his **Elemental Skill.**
* **A4** provides Razor extra **Energy Recharge** when he has less than half of the energy needed for his **Elemental Burst**.

## Additional Notes

* **Elemental Burst** can change Razor's optimal attack combo depending if it's active or not.
  * If Razor's **Elemental Burst** is not active, Razor deals more DPS with a three-hit combo followed by a dash cancel.
  * If Razor's **Elemental Burst** is active, Razor deals more DPS with a full four-hit combo followed by a dash cancel.
* **Elemental Burst** will be cancelled when swapping to another character while it's active. This why Razor is referred as a Selfish Main DPS and it is generally recommended to keep him on the field for as long as possible.
  * An exception to this is when all enemies have be defeated. Cancelling his **Elemental Burst** will return a small amount of energy to Razor.
* Razor's Passive Talent reduces the **Stamina** consumption of sprinting by 20% for the entire team, and is non-stackable with other similar Passive Talents. This makes Razor a good world exploration character, as his claymore can also mine ores.

## Works Well With

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Cryo.webp)

* **Superconduct** is Razor’s core reaction, as it debuffs enemy **Physical** **RES**. Thus, most **Cryo** characters are generally very effective with Razor.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_xingqiu.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_barbara.png)

* Off-Field **Hydro** characters work well with Razor as they can provide useful utility effects such as healing, and can create **Electro-Charged** **Elemental Reactions**.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_beidou.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_fischl.png)

* Beidou’s **Elemental Burst** deals high amounts of Off-Field **Electro** **DMG** and gives Razor **Damage Reduction** and resistance to interruption. Note that Beidou requires investment into **Energy Recharge**.
* Fischl provides energy for Razor and deals Off-Field **Electro** **DMG**.
* Both characters provide **Electro** **Resonance**, which can help with Razor's **Elemental Burst** uptime.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Anemo.webp)

* Most **Anemo** characters can Crowd Control and group enemies, allowing for Razor to hit multiple enemies more easily.
* They also reduce enemy **Electro RES** via **Viridescent Venerer** 4-set effect, increasing Razor's **Electro** **DMG**.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_zhongli.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_albedo.png)

* Zhongli's shield allows Razor to negate incoming damage that might otherwise interrupt his attacks. Additionally, the shield also reduces enemy **Physical RES**. Zhongli's **Elemental Burst** locks enemies in place, preventing them from being knocked back by Razor's attacks.
* Albedo provides Off-Field **Geo DMG** and can generate shields through the **Crystallize** reaction.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_yunjin.png)

* Yunjin boosts Razor's **Normal Attack DMG**.

## **Does Not Work Well With**

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_chongyun.png)

* Razor's kit innately favors **Physical** **DMG**. Chongyun's **Elemental Skill** infusing Razor's **Normal Attacks** to deal **Cryo DMG**, which negates his build's **Physical** **DMG** bonuses.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Pyro.webp)

* **Overload** reactions will knock smaller enemies away from Razor. This may not be an issue with larger enemies or bosses.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Bennett is sometimes run in his team despite this for his healing and **ATK** buff from his **Elemental Burst.** However, this will constantly cause **Overload** reactions around Razor when both **Elemental Bursts** are used simultaneously, knocking away smaller enemies.

**Superconduct**

* A team that runs Razor as Main DPS and a **Cryo** support to cause **Superconduct**.
* Xingqui provides Off-Field **Hydro DMG** and resistance to interruption.
* Fischl acts as an Energy Battery and provides Off-Field **Electro DMG**.
* Diona provides **Cryo** for **Superconduct** and also shields and heals.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Non-Superconduct is generally not recommended, as the Superconduct reaction greatly benefits teams focusing on **Physical DMG**.

**Non-Superconduct**

* This team supplements Razor's **Physical DMG** and **Electro DMG** with the **Electro-Charged** **Elemental Reaction**.
* Strong Off-Field DPS characters and/or **Geo** or **Pyro Resonance** can be used to provide utility and buffs to the team's damage.
