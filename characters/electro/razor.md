# Razor

## Roles

* **Main DPS**

## Character Breakdown

* Normal Attacks are the most vital part of Razor's kit, and he heavily relies on dealing Physical damage.
* Elemental Skill changes based on whether it is tapped or held. 
  * On tap, he deals AOE Electro damage and gains an Electro Sigil \(of which he can hold a maximum of 3\). Each Sigil increases his Energy Recharge. 
  * On hold, he deals Electro damage in a circle around him and converts all of his electro sigils into energy.
* Elemental Burst deals an instance of AoE Electro damage around him and consumes all his Sigils, which then grant him energy. He gains the following effects:
  * Electro damage is dealt alongside each attack
  * Attack Speed increased
  * Charge Attack disabled
  * Increased resistance to interruption
  * Cannot take damage from the Electro-Charged status and has increased Electro Resistance
* At A1, the cooldown on Razor's Elemental Skill is reduced, and activating his Elemental Burst instantly resets the cooldown of his Elemental Skill. 
* At A4, Razor gains extra Energy Recharge when he has less than half of the energy needed for his Elemental Burst.

## Additional Notes

* When his Elemental Burst is not active, Razor deals more damage per second with a three-hit combo followed by a dash cancel to omit the final attack; however, if Razor's Elemental Burst is active he will deal more damage with a full four-hit combo \(dash canceling after the fourth hit\) instead.
* Swapping to another character while Razor's Elemental Burst is active will prematurely end it. It is therefore generally recommended to keep him on the field for as long as possible.
  * An exception to this is when all enemies are dead. Prematurely canceling his Elemental Burst will return a small amount of energy to Razor. 
* Razor's passive reduces sprinting's stamina consumption by 20% partywide \(non-stackable with other effects.\)

## Works Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/element_cryo.webp) 

* Superconduct is Razor’s core reaction, as it lowers enemy resistance to physical damage. Thus, most cryo characters are generally very effective.

* Xingqiu’s Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst can help to heal, reduce damage, and increase Razor’s resistance to interruption, making him an extremely good Sub-DPS for Razor.
* Barbara’s Elemental Skill heals Razor and cleanses pyro debuffs periodically, making her a good pair for him since he benefits the most from Off-Field effects.
* Both provide Off-Field support, making them good additions to the team. 
* Hydro characters will not disrupt superconduct reactions.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_beidou.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_fischl.png) 

* Beidou’s Elemental Burst deals high amounts of Off-Field electro damage and gives Razor more survivability due to damage reduction and resistance to interruption. Note that Beidou requires investment into energy recharge as her Burst costs 80 energy.
* Fischl provides energy for Razor and deals Off-Field electro damage. 
* Both characters provide Electro Resonance, which can help with Razor's Elemental Burst uptime.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%281%29.png) 

* Anemo characters can provide crowd control, grouping enemies such that Razor's attacks can hit multiple times.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_zhongli.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_albedo.png) 

* Zhongli has the best shield for off-field protection, and reduces enemy physical resistance by 20%, additionally his burst petrifies enemies for Razor to hit them.
* Albedo provides a bit of additional damage, and the occasional shield that can be used, solid pick for Razor as well

## **Does Not Work Well With**

\*\*\*\*![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_jean.png) ****

* Jean needs to be swapped to on the field to activate her Elemental Skill and Burst, making it hard to work with Razor as he prefers to be on field for long periods.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_eula.png) 

* As a physical damage dealer himself, he does not work with other physical damage carriers like Eula.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_chongyun.png) 

* Chonyun’s Elemental Skill infuses weapons with Cryo, Razor is not meant to deal cryo damage, using Razor while Chongyun’s Skill is on the field would severely cripple Razor’s damage, avoid using him at all.

## **Teams**

[Physical](../../teams/physical.md)

  ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_razor.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_kaeya.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_diona.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_fischl.png)   


* Kaeya helps to create superconduct reactions with his Skill and Elemental Burst, Diona helps to heal and shield Razor against attacks, last slot is a flex slot based on your needs.
* Overall this team works on activating superconduct reactions to deal lots of physical damage with Razor.
* Kaeya can be replaced with another Cryo application character and Diona with another healer to keep Razor alive.

Non-Superconduct  

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_razor.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_xingqiu.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_xinyan.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_zhongli.png) 

* Alternate team composition you can try if you do not want to build a superconduct based team
* Zhongli for the shield and debuff, Xinyan for the bonus physical damage and Xingqiu for electrocharge reaction and additional damage from his Burst.
* Though this works \(and replaceable with other chars\), I’d still recommend using a superconduct based team as it’s more useful in bringing out Razor’s physical damage.
