# Razor

## Roles

* **Main DPS** (Selfish)

## Character Breakdown

* **Normal Attacks** are the most important part of Razor's kit, as that's his primary source of Damage.
* **Elemental Skill (Tap)** makes Razor deal **Electro** damage and gains an **Electro** Sigil (of which he can hold a maximum of 3). Each Sigil increases his **Energy Recharge**.
* **Elemental Skill (Hold)** makes Razor deal **Electro** damage in an AoE and converts all of his **Electro** Sigils into energy.
* **Elemental Burst** deals an instance of** Electro** damage in an AoE and consumes all his **Electro** Sigils, which then grant him energy. He gains the following effects:
  * Each attack deals additional **Electro** damage.
  * **Attack Speed** increased
  * **Charge Attack** disabled
  * Increased resistance to interruption
  * Cannot take damage from the **Electro-Charged** status and has increased** Electro** Resistance
* **Ascension 1 **reduces the cooldown on Razor's Elemental Skill, and activating his **Elemental Burst **instantly resets the cooldown of his Elemental Skill.
* **Ascension 4** gives Razor gains extra **Energy Recharge** when he has less than half of the energy needed for his **Elemental Burst**.

## Additional Notes

* When his **Elemental Burst **is not active, Razor deals more damage per second with a three-hit combo followed by a dash cancel to omit the final attack; however, if Razor's **Elemental Burst** is active he will deal more damage with a full four-hit combo and dash cancelling after the fourth hit instead.
* Swapping to another character while Razor's **Elemental Burst** is active will cancel it. This why he is referred as a Selfish Main DPS and it is generally recommended to keep him on the field for as long as possible.
  * An exception to this is when all enemies have be defeated. Cancelling his **Elemental Burst** will return a small amount of energy to Razor.
* Razor's Passive Talent reduces the stamina consumption of sprinting by 20% for the entire team, and is non-stackable with other similar Passive Talents. This makes Razor a good world exploration character, as his claymore can also mine ores.

## Works Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Cryo.webp)

* **Superconduct** is Razor’s core reaction, as it debuffs enemy **Physical** Resistance. Thus, most **Cryo** characters are generally very effective with Razor.

* Off-Field **Hydro** characters work well with Razor as they can provide useful utility effects such as healing, and extra damage through **Electro-Charged** Reactions.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Beidou.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Fischl.png)

* Beidou’s** Elemental Burst** deals high amounts of Off-Field **Electro** damage and gives Razor damage reduction and resistance to interruption. Note that Beidou requires investment into **Energy Recharge**.
* Fischl provides energy for Razor and deals Off-Field** Electro **damage.
* Both characters provide **Electro** Resonance, which can help with Razor's** Elemental Burst** uptime.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Anemo.webp)

* Most **Anemo **characters can crowd control and group enemies, allowing for Razor to hit multiple enemies more easily.
* They also reduce enemy **Electro **Resistance via Viridescent Venerer artifact set's debuff, increasing Razor's **Electro** Damage.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Zhongli.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Albedo.png)

* Zhongli's shield allows Razor to negate incoming damage that might otherwise stagger him. Additionally, the shield also reduces enemy physical resistance. Zhongli's **Elemental Burst **locks enemies in place, preventing them from being knocked back by Razor's attacks.
* Albedo provides Off-Field damage and can generate shields through the **Crystallize** reaction.

## **Does Not Work Well With**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Chongyun.png)****

* Razor's kit innately favors **Physical** damage. Chongyun's **Elemental Skill** converts Razor's **Normal Attacks** to **Cryo **damage, which negates his build's **Physical** damage bonuses.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Pyro.webp)

* **Overload** reactions will knock smaller enemies away from Razor. However,** Pyro** can be used on larger enemies for additional damage.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Bennett is sometimes run in his team despite this for his healing and Attack buff from his Elemental Burst. However, this will constantly cause overload reactions around Razor when both Elemental Bursts are used simultaneously, knocking away lighter enemies.

**Superconduct**

* A team that runs Razor as Main Dps and **Cryo **supports to cause **Superconduct**.
* Two** Cryo** characters are often run to act as** Energy Batteries** for one another.
* The last slot can be any utility or damaging character.



{% hint style="warning" %}
Non-Superconduct is generally not recommended, as the Superconduct reaction greatly benefits teams focusing on Physical Damage.

**Non-Superconduct**

* This team suppliments Razor's **Physical** and **Electro** damage with the** Electro-Charged **reaction, providing additional damage and crowd control.
* Strong Sub-DPS and/or **Geo **or **Pyro **Resonance can be used to provide utility and buffs to the team's damage.
