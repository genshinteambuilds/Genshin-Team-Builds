# Thoma

## Roles

* **Off-Field DPS** (Elemental Burst)
* **Support:** Shielder, Buffer (C6)

## Character Breakdown

* **Elemental Skill** deals **AoE** **Pyro** damage, applies **Pyro** to Thoma, and creates a Shield.
  * **Shield Absorption** scales with Thoma's **Maximum HP**.&#x20;
* **Elemental Burst** deals **AoE** **Pyro** damage and causes the active character's **Normal Attacks** to deal additional **Pyro** damage and create a small Shield.
  * **Shield Absorption** scales with Thoma's **Maximum HP**.&#x20;
  * **A4** causes the bonus damage dealt when **Normal Attacking** to be increased by 2.2% of Thoma's **Maximum HP**.
* All of Thoma's Shields can stack on top of each other, refreshing all active Shields duration and combining their **Shield Absorption**.&#x20;
  * Thoma's combined **Shield Absorption** cannot exceed a certain amount.
* **A2** increases the active characters **Shield Strength** by 5% for 6 seconds every time one of Thoma's Shields is created or refreshed, up to a 25% increase.

## Additional Notes

* Often paired with another **Pyro** character, as Thoma's low energy generation makes it difficult to use his **Elemental Burst**.&#x20;
  * **C4** restores 15 energy to Thoma after using his **Elemental Burst**.&#x20;
* The bonus damage and Shielding from his **Elemental Burst** can only be triggered once every second.
* **C6** increases **Normal**, **Charged**, and **Plunging Attack** damage by 15% for the party whenever Thoma creates or refreshes a Shield.

## Works Well With

* **Pyro** Main DPS characters who frequently **Normal Attack** can make full use of Thoma's Shields.
* Thoma's relatively low **Pyro** application does not interfere with **Pyro** Main DPS's **Vaporize** reactions.&#x20;
* Thoma can provide **Pyro Resonance** when combined with these Main DPS.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Anemo.webp)

* As with all **Elemental Damage DPS**, **Anemo** supports work well by reducing the enemy's **Elemental Resistance** via **Viridescent Venerer**. **Anemo** characters often also supply useful grouping Crowd Control and additional offensive party buffs.

## Does Not Work Well With

* As Shields cannot stack on each other, combing Thoma and other Shielding characters such as Zhongli or Diona is not recommended.
* Thoma's Shielding typically reduces the need for a dedicated Healer.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Electro.webp)

* Thoma's **Pyro** application can constantly trigger **Overload** when combined with **Electro** characters, knocking enemies out of attack range and causing time to be wasted chasing them around.
* A Support with high grouping such as Venti or Kazuha can negate this downside.

****[**Overload (Pyro)**](../../teams/overload.md)****

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Yoimiya.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Fischl.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Beidou.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Tohma.png)

* Thoma is used as a Shielder and **Pyro** applicator in this team, providing additional **Pyro** application during Yoimiya's cooldowns.
* Thoma provides **Pyro Resonance** in this team.
* **Overload**'s knockback is not an issue in this team, as Yoimiya's range means you don't have to spend time chasing enemies around.

****[**Pure Pyro**](../../teams/pure-pyro.md)****

****![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Yanfei.png)****![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)****![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Kazuha.png)****![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Tohma.png)****

* Thoma is used as a Shielder and Off-Field DPS in this team, using his **Elemental Burst** to provide additional shielding and damage to the rest of the party.

[**Vaporize (Pyro)**](../../teams/reverse-vaporize.md)****

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Hutao.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Kazuha.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Tohma.png)

* Thoma is used in this team as a Shielder and a **Pyro** applicator for an **Anemo** support to trigger **Viridescent Venerer** 4-set.
* An **Anemo** support such as Kazuha or Venti who can additionally apply **Hydro** is ideal, as Xingqiu's **Hydro** application alone cannot keep up with Hu Tao and Thoma's combined **Pyro** application.
