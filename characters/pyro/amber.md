# Amber

## Roles

* **Support:** Crowd Control (Taunting), Buffer (C6)
* **Burst DPS**

## Character Breakdown

* **Elemental Skill** summons a Baron Bunny which taunts enemies on the field. After a certain duration, Baron Bunny will explode, dealing **Pyro** damage in an area around it.
* **Elemental Burst** fires off a shower of arrows, dealing AoE **Pyro** damage over a short period of time.
  * **A1** increases her **Elemental Burst** radius by 30% and increases it's **Critical Rate** by 10%.
* **A4** boosts Amber's **Attack** by 15% for 10 seconds when hitting a Weak Spot.

## Additional Notes:

* **C2** allows Amber to explode the Baron Bunny generated by her **Elemental Skill** on purpose by attacking it with her **Charged Attack**.
* **C6** allows Amber's **Elemental Burst** to buff the **Movement Speed** and **Attack** of all characters by 15% for 10 seconds.
* Amber can be used with an **Elegy of the End** and **C6** to act as a buffer for the team.

## Works Well With:

* When used as a Main DPS, Amber’s slow **Pyro** application allows her to **Melt** all of her **Charged Attacks.**
* Amber generally does not interfere very much with other **Elemental Reactions**. She can be used on many teams if you have a need for her taunt or are using her with **Elegy of the End** and / or **C6** however, she often does not provide enough utility to justify using her over other available characters.

## Team

### Character Specific Teams

**Melt (Not Recommended)**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Amber.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Kaeya.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Lumine\_Anemo.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Barbara.png)

* An example of a budget team using completely free characters.
* Amber acts as the Main DPS, Melting the **Cryo** applied by Kaeya.
* Teams such as this can technically be used but will result in much lower DPS than more conventional teams listed in the specifical team pages.

**Vaporize (Optimized)**

* This is theoretically Hu Tao's highest damage team although does not have a dedicated healer and is therefore not recommended for newer players.
* Amber can apply **Pyro** with her **Elemental Burst** which can then be swirled by an **Anemo** character. Amber also provides **Pyro Resonance**.
* Amber is specifically chosen here due to access to **Elegy of the End** and her **C6** to provide buffs for Hu Tao.
