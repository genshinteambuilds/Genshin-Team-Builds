# Amber

## Roles

{% hint style="warning" %}
It is generally not recommended to use Amber Support without her 6th constellation and the Elegy of the End 5\* bow

She is also generally not recommended as a DPS as she is arguably one of the weaker damage dealers available.
{% endhint %}

* **Support:** Crowd Control (Taunting), Buffer (Requires C6)
* **Burst DPS**

## Character Breakdown

* Elemental Skill summons Baron Bunny, who will taunt enemies on the field. After a certain duration, Baron Bunny will explode, dealing Pyro damage in an area around it.
* Elemental Burst fires off a shower of arrows, dealing Pyro damage over time inside of the circle.
  * At Ascension 1, her burst has a 30% larger radius and a 10% increase in critical rate.
* At Ascension 4, hitting a weak spot boosts her attack by 15% for 10s.

## Additional Notes:

* Amber at Constellation 2 can do heavy damage by manually triggering her Elemental Skill to explode early.
* Amber at Constellation 6 boosts movement speed and attack of all members by 15% for 10s after using her burst, making it a buffing tool.

## Works Well With:

* In the main DPS role, Amber’s slow Pyro application allows her to melt all of her charged attacks.
* In times when more area damage is needed, Amber can make use of Fischl and Beidou to make use of the overload reaction.

## Doesn’t Work Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Hydro.webp)

* While in the Main DPS role, it is generally better to go for Melt rather than Vaporize.
* Amber also does not work well with other Main DPS on the same team unless she is in the support role.

## Team

Click on the team names below for more details on how the team works and alternative support options that can work with that team.
{% endhint %}

[Melt](../../teams/melt.md)

* Amber’s Charged Attack does considerable damage when activating the Melt reaction by hitting an enemy with Cryo applied to it.
  * At Constellation 2, her Elemental Skill can be use to trigger the melt as well.
* Rosaria Burst applies Cryo to enemies allowing for the Melt reactions.
* Zhongli's shield reduces enemy resistances as well as blocks enemy hits making landing attacks much simpler.
* Bennett is recommended in this team due to Pyro resonance and his ability to buff the attack of active characters.

[Support](../../roles/support/)

* Childe acts as the team's primary source of hydro application with his normal and charged attacks. His Elemental Burst combined with the Vaporize reaction results in a large amount of burst damage as well.
* Xiangling's Elemental Burst makes use of Childe's constant hydro application, as well as the buffs of both Amber and Bennett to do consistant damage.&#x20;
* Amber Constellation 6 and Elegy for the End makes her Elemental Burst grant allies bonus attack and Elemental Mastery
* Bennett provides healing as well as his attack buff from his Elemental Burst
