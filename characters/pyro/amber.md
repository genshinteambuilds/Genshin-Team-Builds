# Amber

## Roles

* **Main DPS**
* **Support:** Taunting, Buffer \(Requires C6\)

## Character Breakdown: 

* Normal Attack: Sharpshooter. Amber has a 5 string attack combo, rapidly firing arrows. Amber can also aim a charged shot, infusing the arrow with pyro when fully charged.
* Explosive Puppet: Amber calls forward the help of Baron Bunny, who will taunt enemies on the field. After a certain duration, Baron Bunny will explode, dealing AoE pyro damage.
* Fiery Rain: Amber will fire off a shower of arrows, dealing pyro damage in the AoE.
* Amber’s First Passive “Every Arrow Finds Its Target”, increases the radius of Fiery Rain by 30% and crit rate by 10%.
* Amber’s Second Passive “Precise Shot”, increases her attack by 15% for 10s after hitting a weak spot.

## Additional Notes:

* When in the support role, Amber fits on any team comp as a fast cryo / electro shield breaker.

## Works Well With:

* In the main DPS role, Amber’s slow pyro application allows her to melt all of her charged attacks. 
* In times when more AoE is needed, Amber can make use of Fischl and Beidou to proc overload.

## Doesn’t Work Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/element_hydro.webp) 

* While in the Main DPS role, it is generally better to go for melt rather than vaporize.
* Amber also does not work well with other Main DPS on the same team unless she is in the support role.
