# Amber

## Roles

* **Burst DPS**
* **Support:** Crowd Control (Taunting), Buffer (Requires C6)

## Character Breakdown

* Elemental Skill summons Baron Bunny, who will taunt enemies on the field. After a certain duration, Baron Bunny will explode, dealing AoE pyro damage.
* Elemental Burst fires off a shower of arrows, dealing pyro damage in the field of the AoE.
  * At A1, Her burst has a 30% larger radius and a 10% increase in crit rate.
* At A4, hitting a weak spot boosts her ATK by 15% for 10s.

## Additional Notes:

* Amber at C2 can do heavy damage by manually triggering her Elemental Skill to explode early.
* Amber at C6 boosts movement speed and ATK of all members by 15% for 10s after using her burst, making it a buffing tool.

## Works Well With:

* In the main DPS role, Amber’s slow pyro application allows her to melt all of her charged attacks.
* In times when more AoE is needed, Amber can make use of Fischl and Beidou to proc overload.

## Doesn’t Work Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Hydro.webp)

* While in the Main DPS role, it is generally better to go for melt rather than vaporize.
* Amber also does not work well with other Main DPS on the same team unless she is in the support role.

* Amber’s CA does considerable damage when melting the cryo application from a cryo character.
  * At C2, her Elemental Skill can be use to trigger the melt as well.
* Bennett is recommended in a slot due to pyro resonance asnd his ability to buff damage.\\

* Amber uses her Elemental Skill to taunt enemies and support the Main DPS off field.
* C6 Makes her considerably more useful in the support role with her buffs.\\
