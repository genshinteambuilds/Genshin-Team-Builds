# Amber

## Roles

{% hint style="warning" %}
It is generally not recommended to use Amber Support without **C6** and/or the **Elegy for the End** bow**.**

She is also generally not recommended as a DPS as she is arguably one of the weaker damage dealers available.
{% endhint %}

* **Support:** Crowd Control (Taunting), Buffer (C6)
* **Burst DPS**

## Character Breakdown

* **Elemental Skill** summons **Baron Bunny**, who will Taunt enemies on the field. After a certain duration, **Baron Bunny** will explode, dealing **Pyro** damage in an area around it.
* **Elemental Burst** fires off a shower of arrows, dealing **Pyro** Damage over time inside of the circle.
  * **A1** increases her **Elemental Burst** radius by 30% and gets a 10% **Critical Rate** buff.
* **A4** boosts Amber's **Attack** by 15% for 10 seconds when hitting a Weak Spot.

## Additional Notes:

* **C2** allows her **Elemental Skill** to explode early, dealing a large amount of damage by performing a **Charged Attack** at **Baron Bunny**.
* **C6** allows Amber's **Elemental Burst** to buff the **Movement Speed** and **Attack** of all characters by 15% for 10 seconds.

## Works Well With:

* In the main DPS role, Amber’s slow **Pyro** application allows her to **Melt** all of her **Charged Attacks.**
* In times when more **AoE** is needed, Amber can make use of Fischl and Beidou to utilize the **Overload** reaction.

## Doesn’t Work Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Hydro.webp)

* While in the Main DPS role, it is generally better to go for **Melt** reactions rather than **Vaporize**.
* Amber also does not work well with other Main DPS on the same team unless she is in the support role.

* Amber's **C6** and the weapon, **Elegy for the End**, makes her **Elemental Burst** grant allies bonus **Attack** and **Elemental Mastery.**
