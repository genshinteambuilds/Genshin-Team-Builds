# Yanfei

## Role

* **Main DPS**

## Character Breakdown

* Normal Attack: Yanfei’s main source of damage comes from her Charged attack. Due to this, conserving Stamina is important. Having 3 Scarlet Seals before doing a charged attack is important if you want to maximise Vaporize/Melt damage
* Her best combo is usually 3 Normal Attacks then 1 Charged Attack
* Elemental Skill: A free damage source and used to get the max amount of Scarlet Seals
* Elemental Burst: Having this on a high uptime is important for maximum charged attack damage especially with its 80 Energy burst cost

## Additional Notes:

* Recommended to only be used at C1 as its her best constellation
* For other constellations the next second best constellation would be C5 and then C6

## Works Well With

* Buffs the team, provides pyro resonance and can generate energy particles for Yanfei.

* A must for pyro dps. Enables for Yanfei to Vaporize her charged attacks and deal damage at the same time.

* They decreases Pyro Res of enemies if they're equipped with a 4 set Viridescent Venerer while providing strong crowd control to gather enemies.
* Kazuha increases Yanfei's Pyro DMG bonus with his talent while Sucrose increases Yanfei's Elemental Master with her talent if they swirl pyro.

* They're used with Yanfei in a overload or vapeload \(vaporize and  overload\) team composition. Even if overload knockback enemies, with Yanfei's range its not a big problem. Both Fischl and Beidou has high off field electro damage and can provide more AoE damage due to overload.

* Zhongli's shield help protecting Yanfei from big damages, prevents Yanfei from getting knockbacked easily, and to stop her charged attack from getting interrupted. His shield can also decrease enemies res.

## Does Not Work Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/element_pyro.webp) 

* Yanfei is better to be used as the only pyro dps in the team.
* Does not include supports like bennett.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/element_electro.webp) 

* Taser-Vape is still a fairly niche comp and overload is something to be avoided.

* Yanfei spams 3 normal attacks followed by a charged attack to do both vaporize and overload

[Melt](../../teams/melt.md)

* Usually used against small mobs, but if against large mobs that can’t be sucked by venti, Ganyu would be preferred as the cryo to keep them inside or near Venti’s Q

* Melt Team which prioritizes on Yanfei getting her CA vaporized
* Usually not as consistent as Reverse vaporize as you’d usually want to wait for the cryo aura to appear if you want to melt with Yanfei

[Reverse Melt](../../teams/reverse-melt.md)

* Yanfei spams with 2 normal attacks followed by a charged attack for rosaria and kaeya to reverse melt.
