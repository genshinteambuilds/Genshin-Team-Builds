# Yanfei

## Roles

* **Main DPS** (Selfish)
* **Support**: Shielder (C4)

## Character Breakdown

* When Yanfei performs a **Normal Attack** she gains 1 stack of **Scarlet Seals** (Max of 3 stacks). They give the following effects:
  * Decreases the **Stamina** cost of her **Charged Attacks** by 15%.
  * Increases the **DMG** of her **Charged Attacks**.
* **Elemental Skill** deals **AoE** **Pyro** **DMG** and grants the max stack of **Scarlet Seals**.
* **Elemental Burst** initially deals high amount of **AoE** **Pyro** **DMG** in an area around her, gaining max stacks of **Scarlet Seals** and applying **Brilliance** to her.
  * **Brilliance** is a buff that Yanfei applies to herself which, increases her **Charged Attack** **DMG** and grants **Scarlet Seals** over the period of her **Elemental Burst** is active.

## Additional Notes

* Her best combo is usually 3 **Normal Attacks** to fully stack her **Scarlet Seals** then followed by 1 **Charged Attack** to consume the **Scarlet Seals** and deal additional **DMG**.
* **C1** allows Yanfei's **Scarlet Seal** to decrease the **Stamina** cost of Yanfei's **Charged Attacks** by a further 10%, and increases resistance to interruption when performing a **Charged Attack**.
  * This can decrease Yanfei's **Charged Attack** cost by up to 75% at Max Stacks.
* **C4** creates a shield when Yanfei casts her **Elemental Burst**. This shield absorbs up to 45% of Yanfei's **Max HP** and lasts 15 seconds.
* **C6** increases the max stacks of **Scarlet Seal** from 3 to 4.
  * Combined with **C1** this will result in Yanfei's **Charged Attacks** costing no **Stamina** with max stacks of **Scarlet Seal.**
* Yanfei's **Brilliance** gets cancelled once she leaves the field. This makes her a Selfish DPS as she does significantly more damage with this buff active.
* **A4** allows Yanfei's to deal an additional instance of **AoE Pyro** **DMG** equal to 80% of her **ATK** when dealing **CRIT DMG** with a **Charged Attack**. This counts as **Charged Attack** **DMG**.

## Works Well With

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_bennett.png)

* Bennett's **Elemental Burst** provides healing and a massive **ATK** buff, making him a recommended character in most teams. He can also activate **Pyro Resonance** which also buffs **ATK**.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_xingqiu.png)

* Yanfei is almost always paired with Xingqiu in order to allow her to **Vaporize** her attacks for 1.5x more damage. Check [**Vaporize (Pyro)**](../../teams/reverse-vaporize.md) for more details.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/element\_anemo.webp)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_zhongli.png)

* As with all **Elemental DMG** DPS characters, **Anemo** supports and Zhongli works well by reducing the enemies' **Elemental RES** with **Viridescent Venerer** 4-set or Zhongli's **Jade Shield**. **Anemo** characters often also supply useful Crowd Control abilities or other buffs.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_fischl.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_beidou.png)

* Beidou and Fischl are used with Yanfei to create multiple **Elemental Reactions** (**Electro-Charged**, **Vaporize** and **Overload**). Even if **Overload** knocks back enemies, with Yanfei's long attack range, it's not an inconvenience. Both Fischl and Beidou provide Off-Field **Electro** **DMG** and **Electro Resonance** which creates additional **Energy Particles** from **Elemental Reactions**.

## Does Not Work Well With

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/element\_electro.webp)

* While Beidou and Fischl can work with Yanfei, **Overload** is still an Elemental Reaction to be avoided as it makes **Vaporize** reactions less consistent.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_hutao.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_xiangling.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_diluc.png)

* Yanfei is better to be used as the only **Pyro** Main DPS in the team as they can steal **Elemental Reactions** from her.
