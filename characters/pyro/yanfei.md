# Yanfei

## Roles

* **Main DPS **(Selfish)
* **Support**: Shielder (C4)

## Character Breakdown

* When Yanfei performs a **Normal Attack** she gains 1 stack of **Scarlet Seals** (Max of 3 stacks). They give the following effects:
  * Decreases the stamina cost of her **Charged Attacks** by 15%.
  * Increases the damage of her **Charged Attacks**.
* **Elemental Skill** deals AoE **Pyro** damage and grants the max stack of **Scarlet Seals**.
* **Elemental Burst **initially deals high amount of AoE **Pyro** damage in an area around her, gaining max stacks of **Scarlet Seals** and applying **Brilliance** to her.
  * **Brilliance** is a buff that Yanfei applies to herself which, increases her **Charged Attack** damage and grants **Scarlet Seals** over the period of her **Elemental Burst** is active.

## Additional Notes

* Her best combo is usually 3 **Normal Attacks **to fully stack her** Scarlet Seals **then followed by 1 **Charged Attack** to consume the **Scarlet Seals** and deal additional damage.
* **C1** allows Yanfei's **Scarlet Seal** to decrease the stamina cost of Yanfei's **Charged Attacks **by a further 10%, and increases resistance to interruption when performing a **Charged Attack**.
  * This can decrease Yanfei's **Charge Attack** cost by up to 75% at Max Stacks.
* **C4** creates a shield when Yanfei casts her **Elemental Burst**. This shield absorbs up to 45% of Yanfei's **Max HP** and lasts 15 seconds.
* **C6** increases the max stacks of **Scarlet Seal** from 3 to 4.
  * Combined with **C1** this will result in Yanfei's **Charged Attacks** costing no stamina with max stacks of **Scarlet Seal.**
* Yanfei's **Brilliance** gets cancelled once she leaves the field. This makes her a Selfish DPS as she does significantly more damage with this buff active.
* **A4** gives other party members a 10% increase in damage after using her **Elemental Burst**, based on how many stacks she gain from **A1** has, it also increases the damage by 1% per stack. This results up to a 20% damage buff.

## Works Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)

* Bennett's **Elemental Burst** provides healing and a massive attack buff, making him a recommended character in most teams. He can also provide **Pyro Resonance** which buffs attack.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)

* Yanfei is almost always paired with Xingqiu in order to allow her to **Vaporize** her attacks for 1.5x more damage. Check [**Vaporize (Pyro)**](../../teams/reverse-vaporize.md)** **for team compositions and notes.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Anemo.webp)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Zhongli.png)

* As with all Elemental Damage DPS, **Anemo** supports and Zhongli work well by reducing the enemy's **Elemental Resistance** with **Viridescent Venerer** or Zhongli's **Jade Shield**. **Anemo** characters often also supply useful Crowd Control abilities or other buffs.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Fischl.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Beidou.png)

* Beidou and Fischl are used with Yanfei to create multiple **Elemental Reactions** (**Electro-Charged**, **Vaporize** and **Overload**). Even if **Overload **knocks back enemies, with Yanfei's long attack range, it's not an inconvenience. Both Fischl and Beidou provide Off-field **Electro **damage and **Electro Resonance** which creates additional **Energy Particles** from **Elemental Reactions**.

## Does Not Work Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Electro.webp)

* While Beidou and Fischl can work with Yanfei, **Overload** is still an Elemental Reaction to be avoided as it makes **Vaporize** less consistent.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Pyro.webp)

* Yanfei is better to be used as the only **Pyro** Main DPS in the team as they can steal **Elemental Reactions** from her.

[**Melt (Cryo)**](../../teams/reverse-melt.md)****

* This team puts Yanfei into a **Support** role. She constantly applies **Pyro** on enemies, which allows Rosaria to create **Melt** reactions with her **Elemental Burst**.

* This team is mainly used against groups of small enemies. Diona and Rosaria provide **Cryo Resonance** along with Rosaria's **Elemental Burst** for a **Critical Rate** boost.
* Venti's **Elemental Burst** infuses with** Cryo **and groups up the enemies constantly applying** Cryo **allowing Yanfei to consistently** Melt** her attacks.

* This team is variation of the **Vaporize (Pyro)** team. Yanfei can periodically **Melt** her attacks while the majority of her **Elemental Reactions** will be** Vaporize**.

* This team allows Yanfei to **Vaporize** her **Charged Attacks** using the **Hydro** applied to the enemy by Xingqiu's** Elemental Burst**.
* Bennett acts as the team's healer while providing an **Attack** buff from his **Elemental Burst**.
* Zhongli debuffs enemies **Pyro Resistance** with his shield while also providing protection from damage.
* Sucrose debuffs enemies' **Pyro Resistance** with** Viridescent Venerer **4-set, as well as providing **Elemental Mastery** buffs.
