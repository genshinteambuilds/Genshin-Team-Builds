# Yanfei

## Roles

* **Main DPS**
* \*\*Support: \*\*Shielder

## Character Breakdown

* Yanfeiâ€™s main source of damage comes from her Charged attack. Due to this, conserving Stamina is important. By using her Normal Attack she gains 1 stack of Scarlet Seals (Max of 3 stacks). Having 3 Scarlet Seals before doing a charged attack is important if you want to maximize Vaporize/Melt damage.
* Her best combo is usually 3 Normal Attacks to fully stack her Scarlet Seals then followed by 1 Charged Attack to consume the Scarlet Seals and deal additional damage.
* Her Elemental Skill is a free damage source and used to get the max stack of Scarlet Seals after pressing it.
* Her Elemental Burst initially deals high amount of AoE pyro damage in an area around her, gaining 3 stacks of Scarlet Seals and applying brilliance to her. Brilliance is a self-buff that give Yanfei Scarlet Seals over the period of her burst is active and increases her charged attack damage. Brilliance is deactivated once she leaves the field.

## Additional Notes:

* Recommended to only be used at C1 as its her best constellation
* For other constellations the next second best constellation would be C5 and then C6

## Works Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)

* Bennett basically works with almost every Pyro DPS. He provides buffing, healing and Pyro Resonance.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)

* Yanfei is almost always paired with Xingqiu in order to allow Yanfei to Vaporize her attacks for 1.5x more damage. Check the [Reverse Vaporize team page](../../teams/reverse-vaporize.md) for team compositions and notes.

* As with all Elemental Damage DPS, Anemo supports and Zhongli work well by reducing the enemy's Elemental Resistance with Viridescent Venerer or Zhongli's Jade Shield. Anemo characters often also supply useful Crowd Control abilities or other buffs.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Fischl.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Beidou.png)

* They're used with Yanfei in an overload or vapeload (vaporize and overload) team composition. Even if overload knockback enemies, with Yanfei's attack range, its not a big problem. Both Fischl and Beidou has high off-field electro damage and can provide more AoE damage due to overload.

## Does Not Work Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Pyro.webp)

* Yanfei is better to be used as the only pyro dps in the team as other pyro characters can steal elemental reactions from her
* Bennett however is the only exception.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Electro.webp)

* Taser-Vape is still a fairly niche comp and Overload is something to be avoided.

[Reverse Vaporize](../../teams/reverse-vaporize.md)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Yanfei.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Sucrose.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Yanfei.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Zhongli.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)

* A typical Yanfei-Xingqiu Reverse Vaporize team composition where Yanfei can vaporize her charged attacks using the Hydro applied to the enemy by Xingqiu's Elemental Burst. Yanfei can consistently vaporize her Charged Attacks with 3 Normal Attacks followed by a Charged Attack.
* Zhongli provides debuffing and shielding while Bennett provides buffing and healing.
* Sucrose provides Elemental Mastery as well as debuffing with Viridescent Venerer.

[Taser](broken-reference/)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Yanfei.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Fischl.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Yanfei.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Beidou.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Fischl.png)

* This composition is a variation of the standard Reverse Vaporize where Yanfei can both do overload and vaporize reactions at the same time.
* Beidou can deal large amounts of off-field damage during her Elemental Burst and can also provide Electro Resonance which lowers Energy Recharge Requirements.

[Melt](../../teams/melt.md)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Yanfei.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Rosaria.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Venti.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Diona.png)

* This composition is usually used against groups of small enemies. Diona and Rosaria provides Cryo Resonance along with Rosaria's Elementa Burst for a Crit Rate boost.&#x20;
* Venti's Elemental Burst infuses with Cryo and groups up the enemies constantly apply cryo allowing Yanfei to Melt her attacks.

* Melt Team which is variation of the Reverse Vaporize composition. Yanfei can periodically Melt her Attacks while the majority of her Elemental Reactions will be Reverse Vaporize.

[Reverse Melt](../../teams/reverse-melt.md)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Yanfei.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Rosaria.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Sucrose.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)

* This team puts Yanfei into a support role as she constantly applies pyro on enemies to allow Rosaria to Reverse Melt.
