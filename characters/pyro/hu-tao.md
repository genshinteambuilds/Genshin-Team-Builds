# Hu Tao

## **Roles**

* **Main DPS**
* **Burst DPS**

## **Character Breakdown**

* **Elemental Skill** knocks back enemies near Hu Tao on activation and buffs Hu Tao’s **Attack** based on her maximum **HP**. It also increases her resistance to interruptions.
* **Elemental Skill** infuses Hu Tao’s **Normal Attack** and **Charged Attacks** with **Pyro**. Using **Charged Attacks** applies **Blood Blossom** to the enemies hit. Enemies affected by **Blood Blossom** will take **Pyro** damage periodically.
* **Elemental Burst** both deals a large amount of damage in an AOE circle around her and heals Hu Tao based on the amount of enemies hit with a maximum of 5 enemies.
* **Elemental Burst** damage and healing are increased if Hu Tao’s **HP** is equal to or less than 50%

## **Additional Notes**

* Hu Tao’s **Ascension 4** talent increases her **Pyro Damage Bonus** by 33% if her **HP** is equal to or less than 50%
* Hu Tao’s **Constellation 1** changes her **attack** pattern/chain from:
* `NA → NA → CA → NA → NA → CA` at **Constellation 0**
* `NA → CA → NA → CA → NA → CA` at **Constellation 1**
  * where `NA` = **Normal Attack** and `CA` = **Charged Attack**
  * Note: `NA → CA` is the result of using a **Charged Attack**. Hu Tao will always start her **Charged Attack** with an initial **Normal Attack**.
  * Animation cancelling the end of the **Charge Attack** is necessary for optimal DPS if using `NA → CA`. Can be done with dash or jump.

## **Works Well With**

****![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)****

* Xingqiu provides strong **Hydro** application enabling Hu Tao to **Vaporize** her attacks for 1.5x more damage. Check the [Reverse Vaporize](../../teams/reverse-vaporize.md) team page for team compositions and notes.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Mona.png)

* An alternative to Xingqiu, this is typically only used in [Oneshot](../../teams/oneshot.md) team compositions where you are relying on amplifying Hu Tao's **Elemental Burst** damage.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Anemo.webp)

* As with all Elemental Damage DPS, **Anemo** Supports work well by reducing the enemy's **Elemental Resistance** via **Viridescent Venerer** provided there is a 2nd pyro in your team. **Anemo** characters often also supply useful grouping CC and additional offensive party buffs.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Geo.webp)

* **Geo** characters work well with Hu Tao as she doesn't have good **Pyro** application. Zhongli can work in reducing enemy **Elemental Resistances** with just having his jade shield active.
* Other **Geo** Characters can increase Hu Tao's **Elemental Mastery** like Albedo with his **Elemental Burst** and also provide **Geo Resonance** that increases Hu Tao's Damage while shielded.
* Can also be equipped with 4-piece Instructor Set for **Elemental Mastery** Buff.

## **Does Not Work Well With**

****![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Cryo.webp)****

* **Melt** team compositions using Hu Tao typically do not work well due to the inability to apply **Cryo** Aura fast enough that Hu Tao will sometimes enables the **Cryo** units instead. Using 2 **Cryo** applicants does not solve it's inconsistency. However if there is an alternative source of damage for Hu Tao like **Reverse Vaporize** on times you cannot **Melt** then it becomes more viable.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Electro.webp)

* **Electro** supports generally do not work well with Hu Tao as the **Overload** reaction causes enemies to be knocked back out of Hu Tao's melee range. This can be mitigated through grouping CC such as Kazuha's **Elemental Skill** but is generally not worth building.
* **Overload** teams can work early in the game. Unfortunately, the downside of knocking back enemies along with **Overload** damage scaling being worse in the late game results in these team compositions falling further and further behind as you progress in the game.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xiangling.png)

* Interferes with Hu Tao **Vaporize** reactions which will result in a Damage loss.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)

* Although Bennett provides an **ATK** buff and also **Pyro** **Resonance**. Bennett can heal Hu Tao over 50% HP which is detrimental to Hu Tao.
* Hu Tao is one of the few units that does not need to rely on Bennett to deal damage which makes him free to be used on other teams.
* [Oneshot](../../teams/oneshot.md) teams however would require a Bennett as Hu Tao's **Elemental Burst** snapshots when cast.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Hutao.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Aether\_Geo.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Zhongli.png)

* A Hu Tao-Xingqiu **Reverse Vaporize** team composition with **Geo** Units where Hu Tao can **Reverse Vaporize** her attacks using the **Hydro** applied to the enemy by Xingqiu's **Elemental Burst**. This takes advantage of **Geo** **Resonance** that further buffs the damage dealt by the character when shielded and increases shield strength making it be able to take more damage before breaking.
* Zhongli provides **Elemental Resistance **shred with his shield while Albedo provides another source of off-field damage and **Elemental Mastery** buff when using his **Elemental Burst** and further enhances Hu Tao’s **Vaporize** damage.
* Geo Traveler can be used if Albedo isn't available as his C1 provides a Crit Rate Buff with his **Elemental Burst**. Can run the 4-piece instructor set to provide** Elemental Mastery** Buff.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Hutao.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Sucrose.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Zhongli.png)

* A Hu Tao-Xingqiu **Reverse Vaporize** team composition where Hu Tao can **Reverse Vaporize** her **Normal** and **Charged Attacks** using the **Hydro** applied to the enemy by Xingqiu's **Elemental Burst**.
* Zhongli provides debuffing and shielding while Bennett provides buffing and healing.
* Sucrose provides **Elemental Mastery** and **Viridescent Venerer** **Elemental Resistance Reduction** but **Swirls** **Hydro** instead of **Pyro** because Hu Tao does not have good pyro application. **Elemental Mastery** Buff is still valuable for Hu Tao's reaction damage making her a viable option.

****[**Melt**](../../teams/melt.md)****

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Hutao.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Kaeya.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Diona.png)

* Hu Tao **Melts** most of her damage during Kaeya's **Elemental Burst**. Having a 4-set intructor set equipped will provide Hu Tao an **Elemental Mastery** boost whenever she melts
* Xingqiu burst allows for some follow up damage using **Reverse Vaporize** as a backup plan because **Melt** reactions are not as consistent.
* Diona can provide Shields and **Cryo** **Resonance**.&#x20;

* A Oneshot team composition where Hu Tao and Mona/Ayaka typically only cast their **Elemental Bursts** and the fight ends before any actual use of **Normal Attacks** needs to take place. For a detailed look at how Oneshots work,[ check out the Oneshot page.](broken-reference/)
