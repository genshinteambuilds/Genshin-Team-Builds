# Hu Tao

## **Roles**

* **Main DPS**
* **Burst Sub DPS**

## **Character Breakdown**

* Elemental Skill knocks back enemies near Hu Tao on activation and buffs Hu Tao’s Attack based on her maximum HP. It also increases her resistance to interruptions.
* Elemental Skill infuses Hu Tao’s Normal Attacks with Pyro. Using Charged Attacks apply Blood Blossom to the enemies hit. Enemies affected by Blood Blossom will take Pyro damage every 4 seconds that last for 8 seconds.
  *    Hu Tao’s typical attack pattern/chain is as follows:
    *  NA → NA → CA → NA → NA → CA
    *  where NA = Normal Attack and CA = Charged Attack
* Elemental Burst both deals a large amount of damage in a AoE and heals Hu Tao based on the amount of enemies hit with a maximum of 5 enemies.
* Elemental Burst damage and healing are increased if Hu Tao’s HP is equal to or less than 50%

## **Additional Notes**

*  Hu Tao’s Ascension 4 talent increase her Pyro Damage bonus by 33% if her HP is equal to or less than 50%
*  Hu Tao can be paired with Bennett, especially if it’s a constellation 6 Bennett where the loss of Hu Tao’s Ascension 4 talent can be compensated by Bennett’s constellation 6 15% pyro damage bonus and a massive attack buff from his Burst.
*  Hu Tao’s constellation 1 change her attack pattern/chain from:
  * NA → NA → CA → NA → NA → CA at constellation 0
  * NA → CA → NA → CA → NA → CA at constellation 1
    * where NA = Normal Attack and CA = Charged Attack

## **Works Well With**

* Hu Tao is almost always paired with Xingqiu in order to allow Hu Tao to Vaporize her attacks for 1.5x more damage. Check the [Reverse Vaporize](../../teams/reverse-vaporize.md) team page for team compositions and notes.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_mona.png) 

* An alternative to Xingqiu, this is typically only used in team compositions where you are relying on amplifying Hu Tao's Elemental Burst damage and do not expect to be attacking the enemy for a longer period of time. Given a long enough period of time to deal damage, using Mona over Xingqiu will result in a DPS loss.

*  Bennett basically works with everything under the sun. He provides buffing, healing and in this case, also Pyro Resonance. Bennett also allows Hu Tao to have another Pyro on the team to reliably apply pyro in which allows Hu Tao’s anemo supports to be able to swirl pyro consistently.

* As with all Elemental Damage DPS, Anemo supports and Zhongli works well by reducing the enemy's Elemental Resistance with Viridescent Venerer or Zhongli's Jade Shield. Anemo characters often also supply useful Crowd Control abilities or other buffs.
* Albedo provides Elemental Mastery buff when using his elemental burst and further enhances Hu Tao’s reaction damage.

## **Does Not Work Well With**

* Melt team compositions using Hu Tao typically do not work well due to the inability to apply Cryo aura fast enough that Hu Tao will be the character causing the Melt reaction and benefiting from the damage amplification. Using 2 cryo applicants do not solve the melt problem

* Electro supports generally do not work well with Hu Tao as the Overload reaction causes enemies to be knocked back out of Hu Tao's melee range. This can be mitigated through CC such as Kazuha's Elemental skill but is generally not worth building.
* Overload teams CAN work early in the game. Unfortunately, the downside of knocking back enemies along with Overload scaling worse in the late game result in these team compositions falling further and further behind as you progress in the game.

* Interfere with Hu Tao vaporize reactions that will result in a DPS loss.

* A typical Hu Tao-Xingqiu Reverse Vaporize team composition where Hu Tao can vaporize her attacks using the Hydro applied to the enemy by Xingqiu's Elemental Burst.
* Zhongli provides debuffing and shielding while Bennett provides buffing and healing.

* A typical Hu Tao-Xingqiu Reverse Vaporize team composition where Hu Tao can vaporize her attacks using the Hydro applied to the enemy by Xingqiu's Elemental Burst.
* Zhongli provides debuffing and shielding while Albedo provides another source of off-field damage and Elemental Mastery buff when using his elemental burst and further enhances Hu Tao’s vaporize damage.
* Enables Geo resonance that further buffs the damage dealt by the character when shielded and increases shield strength making it be able to take more damage before breaking.

* A typical Hu Tao-Xingqiu Reverse Vaporize team composition where Hu Tao can vaporize her attacks using the Hydro applied to the enemy by Xingqiu's Elemental Burst.
* Replace zhongli with sucrose to provide Viridescent **V**enerer elemental shred.
  * Other Anemo character can replace sucrose to provide  Viridescent Venerer elemental shred

[Melt](../../teams/melt.md)

* Damage comes primarily during Ayaka’s burst window. During Ayaka’s burst, Hutao can get 3 charge attacks and a burst to melt if you jump cancel/dash cancel correctly. Do not risk the 3rd charge attack if there has been any delay in getting the attacks off or if an animation cancel is failed, since the timing is quite strict. Xingqiu burst allows for some follow up damage using reverse vaporizes as a backup plan.

*  A Oneshot team composition where Hu Tao and Mona typically only cast their Elemental Bursts and the fight ends before any actual use of Normal Attacks needs to take place. For a detailed look at how Oneshots work,[ check out the Oneshot page.](../../teams/other/oneshot.md)

*  A Oneshot team composition where Hu Tao Melts her Elemental Burst instead of vaporizing it for the massive 2x damage multiplier.
  * Ganyu can be replaced by other Cryo characters.
