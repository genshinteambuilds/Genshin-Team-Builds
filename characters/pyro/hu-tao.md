# Hu Tao

## **Roles**

* **Main DPS**
* **Burst DPS**

## **Character Breakdown**

* Elemental Skill knocks back enemies near Hu Tao on activation and buffs Hu Tao’s Attack based on her maximum HP. It also increases her resistance to interruptions.
* Elemental Skill infuses Hu Tao’s Normal Attack and Charged Attacks with Pyro. Using Charged Attacks applies Blood Blossom to the enemies hit. Enemies affected by Blood Blossom will take Pyro damage periodically.
* Elemental Burst both deals a large amount of damage in an AOE circle around her and heals Hu Tao based on the amount of enemies hit with a maximum of 5 enemies.
* Elemental Burst damage and healing are increased if Hu Tao’s HP is equal to or less than 50%

## **Additional Notes**

*  Hu Tao’s Ascension 4 talent increases her Pyro Damage bonus by 33% if her HP is equal to or less than 50%
*  Hu Tao’s constellation 1 changes her attack pattern/chain from:
  * `NA → NA → CA → NA → NA → CA` at constellation 0
  * `NA → CA → NA → CA → NA → CA` at constellation 1
    * where `NA` = Normal Attack and `CA` = Charged Attack
    * Note: `NA → CA` is the result of using a Charged Attack. Hu Tao will always start her Charged Attack with an initial Normal Attack.
    * Animation cancelling the end of the Charge Attack is necessary for optimal DPS if using `NA → CA`. Can be done with dash or jump. 

## **Works Well With**

* Xingqiu provides strong Hydro application enabling Hu Tao to Vaporize her attacks for 1.5x more damage. Check the [Reverse Vaporize](../../teams/reverse-vaporize.md) team page for team compositions and notes.

* An alternative to Xingqiu, this is typically only used in team compositions where you are relying on amplifying Hu Tao's Elemental Burst damage and do not expect to be attacking the enemy for a longer period of time. Given a long enough period of time to deal damage, using Mona over Xingqiu will result in a DPS loss.

* Provides ATK buff, healing and in this case, also Pyro Resonance. Although Bennett can heal Hu Tao over 50% HP, he is great for amplifying Hu Tao's Elemental Burst damage and/or some Charged Attacks. 
* Allows Hu Tao to have another Pyro on the team to reliably apply pyro in which allows Hu Tao’s anemo supports to be able to swirl pyro consistently.

* As with all Elemental Damage DPS, Anemo supports and Zhongli work well by reducing the enemy's Elemental Resistance via Viridescent Venerer or Zhongli's Jade Shield. Anemo characters often also supply useful grouping CC and additional offensive party buffs.
* Albedo provides Elemental Mastery buff when using his elemental burst and further enhances Hu Tao’s reaction damage.

## **Does Not Work Well With**

* Melt team compositions using Hu Tao typically do not work well due to the inability to apply Cryo aura fast enough that Hu Tao will be the character causing the Melt reaction and benefiting from the damage amplification. Using 2 cryo applicants do not solve the melt problem.

* Electro supports generally do not work well with Hu Tao as the Overload reaction causes enemies to be knocked back out of Hu Tao's melee range. This can be mitigated through grouping CC such as Kazuha's Elemental Skill but is generally not worth building.
* Overload teams can work early in the game. Unfortunately, the downside of knocking back enemies along with Overload scaling worse in the late game result in these team compositions falling further and further behind as you progress in the game.

* Interfere with Hu Tao vaporize reactions that will result in a DPS loss.

* A typical Hu Tao-Xingqiu Reverse Vaporize team composition where Hu Tao can vaporize her Normal and Charged Attacks using the Hydro applied to the enemy by Xingqiu's Elemental Burst.
* Zhongli provides debuffing and shielding while Bennett provides buffing and healing.

* A typical Hu Tao-Xingqiu Reverse Vaporize team composition where Hu Tao can vaporize her attacks using the Hydro applied to the enemy by Xingqiu's Elemental Burst.
* Zhongli provides Elemental resistance shred with his shield while Albedo provides another source of off-field damage and Elemental Mastery buff when using his Elemental Burst and further enhances Hu Tao’s vaporize damage.
* Enables Geo resonance that further buffs the damage dealt by the character when shielded and increases shield strength making it be able to take more damage before breaking.

* A typical Hu Tao-Xingqiu Reverse Vaporize team composition where Hu Tao can vaporize her attacks using the Hydro applied to the enemy by Xingqiu's Elemental Burst.
* Other Anemo characters can replace sucrose to provide Viridescent Venerer elemental shred.

[Melt](../../teams/melt.md)

* Damage comes primarily during Ayaka’s Elemental Burst window. Hu Tao can get 3 Charge attacks and an Elemental Burst to melt if you jump cancel/dash cancel correctly. Do not risk the 3rd charge attack if there has been any delay in getting the attacks off or if an animation cancel is failed, since the timing is quite strict. Xingqiu burst allows for some follow up damage using reverse vaporizes as a backup plan.
