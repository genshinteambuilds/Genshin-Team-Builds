# Hu Tao

## **Roles**

* **Main DPS**
* **Burst DPS**

## **Character Breakdown**

* **Elemental Skill** knocks back enemies near Hu Tao on activation and buffs Hu Tao’s **Attack** based on her **Max HP**. It also increases her resistance to **interruption.**
* **Elemental Skill** infuses Hu Tao’s **Normal Attack** and **Charged Attacks** with **Pyro**. Using **Charged Attacks** applies **Blood Blossom** to the enemies hit. Enemies affected by **Blood Blossom** will take **Pyro** damage periodically.
* **Elemental Burst** both deals a large amount of damage in an **AoE** around her and heals Hu Tao based on the amount of enemies hit with a maximum of 5 enemies.
* **Elemental Burst** damage and healing are increased if Hu Tao’s **HP** is equal to or less than 50%
* **A4** increases Hu Tao's **Pyro Damage** by 33% if her **HP** is equal to or less than 50%

## **Additional Notes**

* **Elemental Skill** will sacrifice 30% of Hu Tao's current **HP** when cast**.**
  * Hu Tao won't die with her **Elemental Skill** as it won't drop her below **1 HP.**
* **C1** makes Hu Tao's **Charged Attack** cost no stamina while her **Elemental Skill** is active.
* Hu Tao's attack combo can depend whenever she is **C0** or **C1**:
  * `NA → CA → JC → NA → CA → JC` at **C0**
  * `NA → CA → DC → NA → CA → DC`at **C1**
    * `NA` = **Normal Attack** `CA` = **Charged Attack** `JC` = **Jump Cancel** `DC` = **Dash Cancel**
    * Note: `NA → CA` is the result of using a **Charged Attack**. Hu Tao will always start her **Charged Attack** with an initial **Normal Attack**.
    * Animation cancelling the end of the **Charge Attack** is necessary for optimal damage if using `NA → CA`. Can be done with **Dash** or **Jump**.
  * Dash Cancels provide more damage overall in Hu Tao's attack combo but it isn't recommended at **C0** because of the **Stamina** consumption from both the **Dash** and **Charged Attack.**
* **Elemental Burst** is mainly used at the end of her attack combo just before her **Elemental Skill** expires or at an emergency when Hu Tao needs to dodge an attack or heal.

## **Works Well With**

****![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)****

* Xingqiu provides strong **Hydro** application enabling Hu Tao to **Vaporize** her attacks for 1.5x more damage. Check the [**Vaporize (Pyro)**](../../teams/reverse-vaporize.md) team page for team compositions and notes.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Mona.png)

* An alternative to Xingqiu, this is typically only used in [**Oneshot**](../../teams/oneshot.md) team compositions where you are relying on amplifying Hu Tao's **Elemental Burst** damage.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Anemo.webp)

* As with all **Elemental Damage** DPS characters, **Anemo** supports work well by reducing the enemies' **Elemental Resistance** with **Viridescent Venerer** 4-set provided that there is a 2nd **Pyro** character on the team. **Anemo** characters often also supply useful Crowd Control abilities or other buffs.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Geo.webp)

* **Geo** characters work well with Hu Tao as she doesn't have good **Pyro** application. Zhongli can work in debuffing enemy **Elemental Resistances** with just having his **Jade Shield** active. His shield also provides protection from damage as Hu Tao sacrifices her **HP** when casting her **Elemental Skill**.
* Other **Geo** Characters can increase Hu Tao's **Elemental Mastery** like Albedo with his **Elemental Burst** and also provide **Geo Resonance** that increases Hu Tao's damage while shielded.
* Can also be equipped with **Instructor** 4-set for additional **Elemental Mastery** Buff.

## **Does Not Work Well With**

****![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Cryo.webp)****

* **Melt** team compositions using Hu Tao typically do not work well due to the inability to apply **Cryo** Aura fast enough that Hu Tao will sometimes enable the **Cryo** characters instead.
  * However if there is an alternative source of damage for Hu Tao like the **Vaporize** reaction on times you cannot **Melt** then it becomes a viable team option.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Electro.webp)

* **Electro** supports generally do not work well with Hu Tao as the **Overload** reaction causes enemies to be knocked back out of Hu Tao's melee range. This can be mitigated through grouping CC such as Kazuha's **Elemental Skill** but is generally not worth building.
* **Overload** teams can work early in the game. Unfortunately, the downside of knocking back enemies along with **Overload** damage scaling being worse in the late game results in these team compositions falling further and further behind as you progress in the game.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xiangling.png)

* Interferes with Hu Tao's **Vaporize** reactions which will results in a Damage loss.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)

* Although Bennett provides an **Attack** buff and **Pyro** **Resonance**. Bennett can heal Hu Tao over 50% **HP** which is detrimental to Hu Tao in most cases.
* Hu Tao is one of the few characters that does not need to rely on Bennett to deal damage which makes him free to be used on other teams.
* [**Oneshot**](../../teams/oneshot.md) teams however would require Bennett as Hu Tao's **Elemental Burst** snapshots when cast.
