# Hu Tao

## **Roles**

* **Main DPS**
* **Burst DPS**

## **Character Breakdown**

* **Elemental Skill** infuses Hu Tao’s **Normal Attack** and **Charged Attacks** with **Pyro** and increases Hu Tao’s **ATK** based on her **Max HP.**
  * **Elemental Skill** consumes 30% of Hu Tao's current **HP** when cast.
  * **Elemental Skill** knocks back enemies near Hu Tao on activation and increases her resistance to interruption.
  * Using **Charged Attacks** while the **Elemental Skill** is active applies Blood Blossom to the enemies hit. Enemies affected by Blood Blossom will take **Pyro** **DMG** periodically.
* **Elemental Burst** deals a large amount of **AoE Pyro** **DMG** and heals Hu Tao based on the number of enemies hit.
  * **Elemental Burst** **DMG** and healing are increased if Hu Tao’s **HP** is equal to or less than 50%.
* **A4** increases Hu Tao's **Pyro DMG** by 33% if her **HP** is equal to or less than 50%

## **Additional Notes**

* **C1** makes Hu Tao's **Charged Attack** cost no stamina while her **Elemental Skill** is active.
* Hu Tao's attack combo can depend on whether she is **C0** or **C1**. 2 common combos are:
  * `NA → NA -> CA → JC → NA -> NA → CA → JC` at **C0**
  * `NA → CA → DC → NA → CA → DC` at **C1**
    * `NA` = **Normal Attack** `CA` = **Charged Attack** `JC` = **Jump** Cancel `DC` = **Dash** Cancel
    * Note: `NA → CA` is the result of using a **Charged Attack**. Hu Tao will always start her **Charged Attack** with an initial **Normal Attack**.
    * Animation cancelling the end of the **Charged Attack** is necessary for optimal damage if using `NA → CA`. Can be done with **Dash** or **Jump**.
  * **Dash** Cancels provide more damage overall in Hu Tao's attack combo but is often not performed at **C0** because of the **Stamina** consumption from both the **Dash** and **Charged Attack.**
  * There are technically many different Hu Tao combo strings beyond always performing 1 **Normal Attack** and then 1 **Charged Attack**.
* **Elemental Burst** is mainly used at the end of her attack combo just before her **Elemental Skill** expires or if Hu Tao needs to dodge an attack or heal.

## **Works Well With**

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_xingqiu.png)

* Xingqiu provides strong **Hydro** application enabling Hu Tao to **Vaporize** her attacks for 1.5x more damage. Check the [**Vaporize (Pyro)**](../../teams/reverse-vaporize.md) team page for team compositions and notes.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_ayaka.png)

* Can be used in [**Oneshot**](../../teams/oneshot.md) Melt team compositions to quickly dispatch an enemy although this is fairly niche.

## **Does Not Work Well With**

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/element\_cryo.webp)

* **Melt** team compositions using Hu Tao typically do not work well due to the inability to apply **Cryo** Aura fast enough that Hu Tao will sometimes enable the **Cryo** characters instead.
  * It is possible to combine Xingqiu with **Cryo** characters to avoid this problem. See [Character Specific Teams](hu-tao.md#character-specific-teams).
  * Ayaka is an exception when used in [Oneshot](../../teams/oneshot.md) teams.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/element\_electro.webp)

* **Electro** supports generally do not work well with Hu Tao as the **Overload** reaction causes enemies to be knocked back out of Hu Tao's melee range. This can be mitigated through Crowd Control abilities such as Kazuha's **Elemental Skill** but is generally not worth building.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_xiangling.png)

* Interferes with Hu Tao's **Vaporize** reactions which will result in a damage loss.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_bennett.png)

* Although Bennett provides an **ATK** buff and **Pyro** **Resonance**. Bennett can heal Hu Tao over 50% **HP** which is detrimental to Hu Tao in most cases.
* It is still technically possible to manage this but is generally avoided.

## **Teams**

Click on the team names below for more details on how the team works and alternative support options that can work with that team.
{% endhint %}

[**Oneshot**](../../teams/oneshot.md)

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_hutao.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_mona.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_kazuha.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_bennett.png)

* A team where Hu Tao and Mona typically cast their **Elemental Bursts** and the fight ends before any actual use of **Normal Attacks** or **Charged Attacks** needs to take place.

[**Vaporize (Pyro)**](../../teams/reverse-vaporize.md)

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_hutao.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_xingqiu.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_albedo.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_zhongli.png)

* Hu Tao can **Vaporize** her attacks using the **Hydro** applied to the enemy by Xingqiu's **Elemental Burst**.
* Zhongli provides an **Elemental RES** debuff with his shield while also protecting the team.
* Albedo provides Off-Field **Geo DMG** and an **Elemental Mastery** buff when using his **Elemental Burst**.
* Using both Albedo and Zhongli gives the team **Geo Resonance**.

### Character Specific Teams

**Vaporize (Optimized)**

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_hutao.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_xingqiu.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_kazuha.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Amber.png)

* This is theoretically Hu Tao's highest damage team although does not have a dedicated Healer and is therefore not recommended for newer players.
* Amber can apply **Pyro** with her **Elemental Burst** which can then be swirled by an **Anemo** character. Amber also provides **Pyro Resonance**.
* Amber and Kazuha are specifically chosen here due to access to **Freedom Sworn**, **Elegy of the End**, as well as a host of buffs and debuffs. Alternative **Anemo** or **Pyro** character can be used over these two characters but may result in slightly lower DPS.

**Vaporize (+Melt)**

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_hutao.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_xingqiu.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_kaeya.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_diona.png)

* A **Cryo** Off-Field DPS character coupled with Diona can allow Hu Tao to occasionally **Melt** attacks alongside the normal **Vaporizes** from Xingqiu.
* Diona is particularly useful since she also provides shielding and reduces stamina consumption allowing Hu Tao to execute more **Charged Attacks**.

{% hint style="info" %}
The occasional **Freeze** provides **Crowd Control** which may make it easier to play against more mobile enemies.
