# Klee

## Roles

* **Main DPS**
* **Support:** Debuffer (C2), Buffer (C6)

## Character Breakdown

* **Elemental Skill** throws a Jumpty Dumpty, which bounces 3 times and explodes into 8 mines. Jumpty Dumpty starts with 2 charges.
* **A1** gives Klee a 50% chance to gain an explosive spark when normal attacks and Jumpty Dumpty hit opponents. When in possession of a spark, Klee’s next **Charged Attack** will cost 0 stamina and have 50% increased damage.
* Elemental Burst summons 4 Sparks ‘n’ Splash 5 times over 10 seconds, dealing AoE **Pyro** Damage to nearby enemies.
* **A4** gives party members 2 **Elemental Energy** when Klee’s **Charged Attacks** deals **Critical Damage.**

## Additional Notes

* **C2** allows Klee to be used as support by throwing out her 2 Jumpty Dumpty and switching out, as stepping on the mines reduces opponents **Defense** by 23% for 10 seconds.
* At **C6**, Klee buffs all party members **Pyro** Damage by 10% for 25s after using her **Elemental Burst.**

* In the main DPS role, Klee’s rapid **Pyro** application allows her to be used in Pure **Pryo**, **Melt** (**Cryo**) or **Vaporize** teams.
* In Klee’s **Vaporize** comp, do not use Klee’s **Elemental Burst** or else **Vaporize** will be inconsistent.

## Doesn’t Work Well With

* **Overload** is generally not optimal with Klee because overload pushes enemies out of Klee’s reach.
