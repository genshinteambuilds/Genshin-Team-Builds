# Klee

## Roles

* **Main DPS**
* **Support:** Debuffer (C2), Buffer (C6)

## Character Breakdown

* **Elemental Skill** throws a Jumpty Dumpty, which bounces 3 times and explodes into 8 mines. Jumpty Dumpty starts with 2 charges.
* **A1** gives Klee a 50% chance to gain an Explosive Spark when **Normal attacks** and Jumpty Dumpty hits enemies. When in possession of Explosive Spark, Klee’s next **Charged Attack** will cost no **Stamina** and have a 50% **DMG Bonus**.
* **Elemental Burst** summons 4 **Sparks ‘n’ Splash** 5 times over 10 seconds, dealing **AoE** **Pyro DMG** to nearby enemies.
* **A4** gives party members 2 energy when Klee’s **Charged Attacks** deals **CRIT DMG.**

## Additional Notes

* **C2** allows Klee to be used as support by throwing out her 2 Jumpty Dumpty and switching out, as the mines reduces enemies' **DEF** by 23% for 10 seconds.
* At **C6**, Klee provides 3 energy to the party every 3 seconds while her **Elemental Burst** is active. Klee also buffs all party members **Pyro DMG** by 10% for 25 seconds after casting her **Elemental Burst.**

* In the main DPS role, Klee’s rapid **Pyro** application allows her to be used in **Pure** **Pyro**, **Melt (Cryo)** or **Vaporize** teams.
* In Klee’s **Vaporize** teams, her **Elemental Burst** can apply **Pyro** too fast and causes **Vaporize** reactions to be inconsistent.

## Doesn’t Work Well With

* **Overload** is generally not advised with Klee as overload may push smaller enemies out of Klee’s reach.

* Klee's goal is to deal as much **Pyro DMG** as possible through her **Charged Attack**, **Elemental Skill** during her **Elemental Burst**.
* Xiangling and Bennett provide Off-Field **Pyro** application and team buffing respectively.
* Kazuha provides **Pyro RES** debuff through **Viridescent Venerer** 4-set and buffs **Pyro DMG** with his **A4**.

* Klee triggers **Vaporize** reactions with her **Charged Attack**, **Elemental Skill** and **Elemental Burst**. True only if Xingqiu is C6 due to too much **Pyro** application by Klee herself.
* Xingqiu applies **Hydro** on enemies with his **Elemental Burst** and provides resistance to interruption.
* Sucrose debuffs enemies' **Pyro RES** with **Viridescent Venerer** while also buffing **Elemental Mastery**.
