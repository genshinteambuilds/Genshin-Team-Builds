# Klee

## Roles

* **Main DPS**
* **Support:** Debuffer \(C2\), Buffer \(C6\)

## Character Breakdown: 

* Normal Attack: Kaboom! Klee throws 3 normal attacks dealing pyro damage. After consuming stamina, Klee can release a charged attack dealing pyro damage.
* Jumpty Dumpty: Klee throws a Jumpty Dumpty, which bounces 3 times and explodes into 8 mines. Jumpty Dumpty starts with 2 charges.
* Sparks ‘n’ Splash: Klee summons 4 Sparks ‘n’ Splash 5 times over 10 seconds, dealing Aoe pyro damage.
* Klee’s First Passive “Pounding Suprise”, allows Klee a 50% chance to gain an explosive spark when normal attacks and Jumpty Dumpty hit opponents. When in possession of a spark, Klee’s next charged attack will cost 0 stamina and have 50% increased dmg.
* Klee’s Second Passive “Sparkling Burst”, gives teammates 2 elemental energy when Klee’s charged attacks hit.

## Additional Notes:

* With C2, Klee can be used as support by throwing out her 2 Jumpty Dumpty and switching out.

## Works Well With:

* In the main DPS role, Klee’s rapid pyro application allows for mono pyro, reverse melt, or vaporize team comps.
* In Klee’s vaporize comp, do not use Klee’s elemental burst or else vaporize will be inconsistent.

## Doesn’t Work Well With:

* Overload is generally not optimal with Klee because overload pushes enemies out of Klee’s reach.
