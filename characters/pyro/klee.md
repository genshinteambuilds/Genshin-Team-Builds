# Klee

## Roles

* **Main DPS**
* **Support:** Debuffer (C2), Buffer (C6)

## Character Breakdown

* Elemental Skill throws a Jumpty Dumpty, which bounces 3 times and explodes into 8 mines. Jumpty Dumpty starts with 2 charges.
* A1 gives Klee a 50% chance to gain an explosive spark when normal attacks and Jumpty Dumpty hit opponents. When in possession of a spark, Klee’s next charged attack will cost 0 stamina and have 50% increased damage.
* Elemental Burst summons 4 Sparks ‘n’ Splash 5 times over 10 seconds, dealing AoE Pyro Damage to nearby enemies.
* A4 gives party members 2 elemental energy when Klee’s charged attacks deals Critical Damage.

## Additional Notes

* With C2, Klee can be used as support by throwing out her 2 Jumpty Dumpty and switching out (stepping on the mines reduces opponents Defence by 23% for 10s)
* At C6, Klee buffs all party members Pyro Damage by 10% for 25s after using her Elemental Burst.

* In the main DPS role, Klee’s rapid pyro application allows for mono pyro, reverse melt, or vaporize team comps.
* In Klee’s vaporize comp, do not use Klee’s elemental burst or else vaporize will be inconsistent.

## Doesn’t Work Well With

* Overload is generally not optimal with Klee because overload pushes enemies out of Klee’s reach.
