# Thoma

## Roles

* **Off-Field DPS** (Elemental Burst)
* **Support:** Shielder, Buffer (C6), Cleanser (Self)

## Character Breakdown

* **Elemental Skill** deals **AoE** **Pyro** **DMG**, applies **Pyro** to Thoma, and creates a Shield.
  * The Shield's damage absorption scales with Thoma's **Max HP**.
* **Elemental Burst** deals **AoE** **Pyro** **DMG** and causes the active character's **Normal Attacks** to deal additional **Pyro** **DMG** and create a small Shield.
  * The additional **Pyro DMG** from Normal Attacks can only be triggered every 1s.
  * The Shield's damage absorption scales with Thoma's **Max HP**.
* **A4** causes the additional **Pyro DMG** dealt from **Normal Attacks** while Thoma's **Elemental Burst** is active to be increased by 2.2% of Thoma's **Max HP**.
* All of Thoma's shields can stack on top of each other, refreshing the duration and combining their shield **HP.**
  * Thoma's combined shield **HP** cannot exceed a certain amount.
* **A2** increases the active characters **Shield Strength** by 5% for 6 seconds every time one of Thoma's Shields is created or refreshed, up to a 25% increase.

## Additional Notes

* Often paired with another **Pyro** character, as Thoma's low energy generation makes it difficult to use his **Elemental Burst**.
  * **C4** restores 15 Energy to Thoma after using his **Elemental Burst**.
* **C6** increases **Normal**, **Charged**, and **Plunging Attack** **DMG** by 15% for the party for 6 seconds whenever Thoma creates or refreshes a Shield.

## Works Well With

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Yanfei.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Yoimiya.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Hutao.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Diluc.png)

* **Pyro** Main DPS characters who frequently **Normal Attack** can make full use of Thoma's Shields.
* Thoma's relatively low **Pyro** application generally does not interfere with **Pyro** Main DPS's **Vaporize** reactions.
* Thoma can activate **Pyro Resonance** when combined with these Main DPS.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Anemo.webp)

* As with all **Elemental DMG** DPS characters, **Anemo** supports works well by reducing the enemies' **Elemental Resistance** with **Viridescent Venerer** 4-set. **Anemo** characters often also supply useful Crowd Control abilities or other buffs.

## Does Not Work Well With

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Zhongli.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Diona.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Kokomi.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Barbara.png)

* As shields from other characters cannot stack on top of each other, combing Thoma and other shielding characters such as Zhongli or Diona is not recommended.
* Thoma's shielding typically reduces the need for a dedicated Healer.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Electro.webp)

* Thoma's **Pyro** application can constantly trigger **Overload** when combined with **Electro** characters, knocking enemies out of attack range and causing time to be wasted chasing them around.
* A Support with high grouping such as Venti or Kazuha can negate this downside.

[**Overload (Pyro)**](../../teams/overload.md)

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Yoimiya.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Fischl.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Beidou.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Tohma.png)

* Thoma's shield and Beidou's **Damage Reduction** are used instead of a dedicated healer here.
* Thoma's **Pyro** application in this team can help with triggering **Overload Elemental Reactions**.
* Thoma activates **Pyro Resonance** in this team.
* **Overload**'s knockback is not as much of an issue in this team, as Yoimiya's range means you don't have to spend time chasing enemies around.

[**Pure Pyro**](../../teams/pure-pyro.md)

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Yanfei.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Tohma.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Kazuha.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)

* Thoma provides additional shielding for the team but may be replaced for other options if shielding is not required.

[**Vaporize (Pyro)**](../../teams/reverse-vaporize.md)

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Hutao.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Kazuha.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Tohma.png)

* Thoma's shield and Xingqiu's **Damage Reduction** are used instead of a dedicated healer here. This also helps with managing Hu Tao's **HP** to maintain buffs below 50% **HP**.
* Thoma allows **Pyro** application outside of Hu Tao's abilities to be able to **Swirl Pyro** with an **Anemo** support to decrease enemy **Pyro Resistance** using the **Viridescent Venerer** 4-set.
