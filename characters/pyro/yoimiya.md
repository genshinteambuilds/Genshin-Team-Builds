# Yoimiya

## Roles

* **Main DPS**
* **Off-Field DPS** (Elemental Burst)
* **Support:** Buffer (A4)

## Character Breakdown

* When peforming her **Charged Attack** there are 2 charge levels. At **Charge level 1,** she fires off a flaming arrow. At level 2, she can generate up to 3 **Kindling Arrows** based on charge time, which will home onto nearby enemies.
* **Elemental Skill** increases Yoimiya's **Normal Attack** **DMG** and converts it to **Pyro** **DMG**, which cannot be overridden and ends early if Yoimiya leaves the field.
* **Elemental Burst** deals **AoE** **Pyro** **DMG** and marks an opponent hit with **Aurous Blaze**.
  * Excluding Yoimiya, whenever a character hits an enemy marked with **Aurous Blaze** it will trigger an explosion and deal extra **Pyro AoE** **DMG**. The mark is transferred to another enemy if they are defeated before the duration her **Elemental Burst** ends.
* **A1** increases Yoimiya’s **Pyro** **DMG** during her **Elemental Skill** duration by 2% per hit, which lasts for 3 seconds and stacks up to 10 times.
* **A4** allows Yoimiya to give other team members a 10% **ATK** buff after using her **Elemental Burst**. A further buff to ATK is given based on the number of stacks Yoimiya has gained from her **A1**.

## Additional Notes

* She cannot charge kindling arrows when her **Elemental Skill** is active.
* The explosion from her **Elemental Burst** can only be triggered once every 2 seconds.
* Her 1st, 3rd, and 5th **Normal Attack** can react with elements leaving a potential for **Vaporize** or **Melt** reactions.

## Works Well With

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Ganyu.png)

* Ganyu’s **Elemental Burst** can trigger **Melt** reactions with Yoimiya’s **Elemental Skill** and **Burst**.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)

* Xingqiu’s **Elemental Skill** and **Burst** help to protect Yoimiya with **Damage Reduction** and resistance to interruption, as well enable **Vaporize** reactions with his **Elemental Burst**. It also triggers her **Elemental Burst DMG** on enemies marked with **Aurous Blaze** while being Off-Field.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Beidou.png)

* Beidou’s **Elemental Burst** synergizes well with Yoimiya's **Normal Attacks**, causing **Overload Elemental Reactions** that helps teams using Yoimiya deal **AoE** damage. This is useful as Yoimiya's kit is primarily geared towards single target damage.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)

* Bennett's **Elemental Burst** provides healing and a massive **ATK** buff, making him a recommended character in most teams. He can also provide **Pyro Resonance** which buffs ATK.
* He can act as an **Energy Battery** for Yoimiya, recharging her **Elemental Burst** faster.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Anemo.webp)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Zhongli.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Albedo.png)

* As with all **Elemental DMG** DPS characters, **Anemo** supports and Zhongli works well by reducing the enemies' **Elemental Resistance** with **Viridescent Venerer** 4-set or Zhongli's **Jade Shield**. **Anemo** characters often also supply useful Crowd Control abilities or other buffs.
* Albedo provides **Elemental Mastery** buff when using his **Elemental Burst**.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Yunjin.png)

* Buffs Yoimiya's **Normal Attacks**.

## Does Not Work Well With

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Mona.png)

* Mona’s **Omen** debuff from her **Elemental Burst** lasts for only a few seconds.
* Mona cannot apply **Hydro** as often as Xingqiu which will result in Yoimiya triggering **Vaporize** inconsistently.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Cryo.webp)

* Other **Cryo** characters cannot apply Off-Field **Cryo** as often as Ganyu which will result in Yoimiya being unable to **Melt** as consistently.
* Diona and Rosaria could work, but should only be used if Ganyu isn't available.

## Teams

[**Overload (Pyro)**](../../teams/overload.md)

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Yoimiya.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Beidou.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Fischl.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)

* With other **Electro** characters applying **Electro** to enemies, Yoimiya can use her **Elemental Skill** and then her **Normal Attacks** to create **Overload** reactions.
* Beidou's **Elemental Burst** in particular helps with dealing **AoE** damage to enemies which makes up for Yoimiya's damage primarily being single target. A second **Electro** character like Fischl is often also used to provide **Electro Resonance** and recharge Beidou's **Elemental Burst** faster.

[**Vaporize (Pyro)**](../../teams/reverse-vaporize.md)

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Yoimiya.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Albedo.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Zhongli.png)

* Xingqiu’s **Elemental Burst** applies **Hydro** on enemies whenever Yoimiya performs a **Normal Attack**, which allows for **Vaporize** reactions if Yoimiya's **Elemental Skill** is active. It additionally triggers Yoimiya's **Aurous Blaze** on marked enemies.
