# Yoimiya

## Roles

* **Main DPS**
* **Off-Field DPS** (Elemental Burst)
* **Support:** Buffer (A4)

## Character Breakdown

* When charging her aimed shot, at charge level 1, she fires off a flaming arrow. At level 2, she can generate up to 3 kindling arrows based on charge time, which will home onto nearby enemies.
* Yoimiya's Elemental Skill increases her DMG and converts it to Pyro damage, which cannot be overridden and ends early if Yoimiya leaves the field.
* Yoimiya's Elemental Burst deals AoE Pyro damage and marks an opponent hit with a marker. Whenever a character hit the marked enemy besides Yoimiya would trigger an explosion and deal extra Pyro AOE damage. The mark is transferred when the enemy is defeated before the duration of the Burst ends.

## Additional Notes

* She cannot charge kindling arrows when her Elemental Skill is active
* The explosion from her burst can only be triggered once every 2 seconds
* Her 1st, 3rd, and 5th Normal attack can react with elements which has potential for vaporize or melt reactions.
* Her first passive talent increases Yoimiya’s pyro damage during her Skill’s duration by 2% per hit, which lasts for 3s and stacks up to 10 times.
* Her second passive talent gives her other party members a 10% increase in DMG after using her Burst, based on how many stacks her first passive has, it also boosts the DMG increase by 1% per stack.

## Works Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Ganyu.png)

* Ganyu’s Elemental Burst can trigger melt reactions with Yoimiya’s Burst and Skill, applying the DMG.

* Xingqiu’s Elemental Skill and Burst help to protect Yoimiya with the DMG reduction and proc Vaporize reactions with his elemental burst. It also triggers her Burst damage on marked targets while being off-field.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Beidou.png)

* Beidou’s Elemental Burst synergizes well with Yoimiya's Normal Attacks, causing overload that helps Yoimiya with AoE damage since she only has one on her burst.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)

* Bennett heals and increases Yoimiya’s ATK with his burst, and can battery for her, making him an excellent support.
* He also enables pyro resonance, which allows Yoimiya to have more attack.

* As with all Elemental Damage DPS, Anemo supports and Zhongli work well by reducing the enemy's Elemental Resistance via Viridescent Venerer or Zhongli's Jade Shield. Anemo characters often also supply useful grouping Crowd Control and additional offensive party buffs.
* Albedo provides Elemental Mastery buff when using his elemental burst and further enhances Yoimiya's reaction damage.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Jean.png)

* Jean is an all rounded support, can heal, provide Crowd Control, provide the 4 piece Viridescent Venerer set bonus, and is overall a great utility for Yoimiya.

## Does Not Work Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Mona.png)

* Mona’s burst buff lasts for only a few seconds, and her bubble pops immediately.
* She also isn’t good as hydro applicator for Yoimiya to vaporize, making Xingqiu a much better option.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Cryo.webp)

* While Ganyu works as a melt enabler, the other cryo characters are not as good as applying cryo for melt.
* Diona and Rosaria could work, but should only be used if you don’t have Ganyu.

## Teams

[**Overload**](../../teams/overload.md)

* Yoimiya acts as a good trigger for Beidou Burst procs.
* When Beidou’s Burst is active, Yoimiya can use her skill and proc overload reactions and keep them away. Beidou's burst also help in dealing AoE damage to enemies which Yoimiya lacks.
* Last slot is a flexible spot, could be someone such as Bennett for Pyro resonance, healing, and attack buff or Zhongli for more protection and crowd control. Any healer, shielder, or buffer would do.

[**Reverse Vaporize**](../../teams/reverse-vaporize.md)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Yoimiya.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Sucrose.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)

* Xingqiu’s Elemental Burst applies Hydro aura on enemies that synergizes well with Yoimiya's Normal Attacks infused with Pyro to vaporize. It also triggers Yoimiya's burst on marked enemies.

****[**Melt**](../../teams/melt.md)****

* Ganyu and Venti’s Burst will create a Cryo infused Venti Burst, enabling Yoimiya to use her Skill and create melt reactions.
