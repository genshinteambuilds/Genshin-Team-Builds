# Yoimiya

## Roles

* Main DPS

## Character Breakdown

* When charging her aimed shot, at charge level 1, she fires off a flaming arrow. At level 2, she can generate up to 3 kindling arrows based on charge time, which will home onto nearby enemies.
* Her Elemental Skill increases her DMG and converts it to Pyro damage, which cannot be overridden and ends early if Yoimiya leaves the field.
* Her Elemental Burst deals AOE Pyro damage and marks an opponent hit with a marker. Characters other than Yoimiya that hit the marked enemy would trigger an explosion and deal extra Pyro AOE damage. The mark is transferred when the enemy is defeated before the duration of the Burst ends.

## Additional Notes

* She cannot charge kindling arrows when her Elemental Skill is active
* The explosion from her burst can only be triggered once every 2 seconds
* Her 1st, 3rd, and 5th Normal attack can react with elements which has potential for vaporize or melt reactions.
* Her first passive \(Tricks of the Troublemaker\), increases Yoimiya’s pyro damage during her Skill’s duration by 2% per hit, which lasts for 3s and stacks up to 10 times.
* Her second passive \(Summer Night’s Dawn\), after using her Burst, gives her other party members a 10% increase im DMG, based on how many stacks her first passive has, it also boosts the DMG increase by 1% per stack.

## Works Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_ganyu.png) 

* Ganyu’s Burst can trigger melt reactions with Yoimiya’s Burst and Skill, applying the DMG.

* Xingqiu’s Elemental Skill and Burst help to protect Yoimiya and proc Vaporise reactions with his burst. It also triggers her Burst damage.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_beidou.png) 

* Beidou’s Elemental Burst allows Yoimiya to proc Beidou’s damage by activating Beidou’s Burst as much as possible

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_bennett.png) 

* Bennett boosts Yoimiya’s damage and a battery for her, making him an excellent support.
* He also enables pyro resonance, which allows Yoimiya to deal even more damage.

* As with all Elemental Damage DPS, Anemo supports and Zhongli work well by reducing the enemy's Elemental Resistance via Viridescent Venerer or Zhongli's Jade Shield. Anemo characters often also supply useful grouping CC and additional offensive party buffs.
* Albedo provides Elemental Mastery buff when using his elemental burst and further enhances Hu Tao’s reaction damage.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_jean.png) 

* Jean is just an all rounder support, can heal and provide utility.

## Does Not Work Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_mona.png) 

* Mona’s burst buff lasts for only a few seconds, and her bubble pops immediately.
* She also isn’t good at causing vaporisation reactions, making Xingqiu a much better support.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/element_cryo.webp) 

* While Ganyu works as a melt enabler, the other cryo characters are not as good as applying cryo for melt.
* Diona and Rosaria could work, but should only be used if you don’t have Ganyu.

* Yoimiya acts as a good enabler for Beidou.
* When Beidou’s Burst is active, Yoimiya can use her skill and proc overload reactions and keep them away.
* Last slot is a flex comp, such as Bennett for pyro resonance or Zhongli for more protection and CC.
