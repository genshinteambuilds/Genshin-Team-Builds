# Yoimiya

## Roles

* **Main DPS**
* **Off-Field DPS** (Elemental Burst)
* **Support:** Buffer (A4)

## Character Breakdown

* When peforming her **Charged Attack** there are 2 charge levels. At **Charge level 1,** she fires off a flaming arrow. At level 2, she can generate up to 3 **Kindling Arrows** based on charge time, which will home onto nearby enemies.
* **Elemental Skill** increases Yoimiya's **Normal Attack** damage and converts it to **Pyro** damage, which cannot be overridden and ends early if Yoimiya leaves the field.
* **Elemental Burst** deals AoE **Pyro** damage and marks an opponent hit with **Aurous Blaze**.
  * Excluding Yoimiya, whenever a character hits an enemy marked with **Aurous Blaze** it will trigger an explosion and deal extra **Pyro** AoE damage. The mark is transferred to another enemy if they are defeated before the duration her **Elemental Burst** ends.
* **A1** increases Yoimiya’s **Pyro** Damage during her **Elemental Skill**’s duration by 2% per hit, which lasts for 3s and stacks up to 10 times.
* **A2** allows Yoimiya to give other characters a 10% increase in Damage after using her **Elemental Burst**, based on how many stacks she gains with **A1**, it also increases their Damage by 1% per stack.
  * This can result in up to a 20% Damage buff for the entire team while her **Elemental Burst** is active.

## Additional Notes

* She cannot charge kindling arrows when her **Elemental Skill** is active.
* The explosion from her **Elemental Burst** can only be triggered once every 2 seconds.
* Her 1st, 3rd, and 5th **Normal Attack** can react with elements leaving potential for **Vaporize** or **Melt** reactions.

## Works Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Ganyu.png)

* Ganyu’s **Elemental Burst** can trigger **Melt** reactions with Yoimiya’s **Elemental Skill** and **Burst**.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)

* Xingqiu’s **Elemental Skill** and **Burst** help to protect Yoimiya with damage reduction and resistance to interruption, as well enable **Vaporize** reactions with his **Elemental Burst**. It also triggers her **Elemental Burst** damage on enemies marked with **Aurous Blaze** while being off-field.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Beidou.png)

* Beidou’s **Elemental Burst** synergizes well with Yoimiya's **Normal Attacks**, causing **Overload** that helps Yoimiya with AoE damage as her kit is mainly single target focused.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)

* Bennett's **Elemental Burst** provides healing and a massive Attack buff, making him a recommended character in most teams. He can also provide **Pyro Resonance** which buffs attack.
* He can act as an **Energy Battery** for Yoimiya, recharging her **Elemental Burst** faster.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Anemo.webp)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Zhongli.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Albedo.png)

* As with all **Elemental Damage DPS**, **Anemo** supports and Zhongli work well by reducing the enemy's **Elemental Resistance** via **Viridescent Venerer** or Zhongli's **Jade Shield**. **Anemo** characters often also supply useful grouping Crowd Control and additional offensive party buffs.
* Albedo provides **Elemental Mastery** buff when using his **Elemental Burst** and further enhances Yoimiya's **Elemental Reaction** damage.

## Does Not Work Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Mona.png)

* Mona’s **Omen** debuff from her Elemental lasts for only a few seconds, as her bubble pops immediately upon taking damage.
* Mona cannot apply **Hydro** as often as Xingqiu which will result in Yoimiya being unable to **Vaporize** consistently.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Cryo.webp)

* Other **Cryo** characters cannot apply off-field **Cryo** as often as Ganyu which will result in Yoimiya being unable to **Melt** consistently.
* Diona and Rosaria could work, but should only be used if Ganyu isn't available.

## Teams

[**Melt (Pyro)**](../../teams/melt.md)****

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Yoimiya.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Ganyu.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Venti.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Zhongli.png)

* Venti's **Elemental Burst** will provide Crowd Control by grouping up small enemies close together. Ganyu's **Elemental Burst** will infuse Venti's **Elemental Burst** with **Cryo**. This can allow Yoimiya to use her **Elemental Skill** and create **Melt** reactions.

[**Overload**](../../teams/overload.md)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Yoimiya.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Fischl.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Beidou.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Yoimiya.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Beidou.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_aether\_electro.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Zhongli.png)

* In this team Yoimiya can consistently trigger Beidou's **Elemental Burst** as she has a high attack speed.
* When Beidou’s **Elemental Burst** is active, Yoimiya can use her **Elemental Skill** and create **Overload** reactions and keep them away from melee range. Beidou's **Elemental Burst** also help in dealing AoE damage to enemies which Yoimiya lacks.
* A second **Electro** character like Fischl or Traveler (Electro) can be used to provide **Electro Resonance**, and recharge Beidou's **Elemental Burst** faster.
* Bennett acts as the team's healer while providing an attack buff from his **Elemental Burst**. He can also be an **Energy Battery** for Yoimiya.
* Zhongli provides a **Pyro Resistance** debuff on enemies as well as protection from damage with his shield.

[**Vaporize (Pyro)**](../../teams/reverse-vaporize.md)****

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Yoimiya.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Sucrose.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)

* Xingqiu’s **Elemental Burst** applies **Hydro** on enemies with Yoimiya's **Normal Attacks**, which allows for **Vaporize** reactions if Yoimiya's **Elemental Skil** is active. It also triggers Yoimiya's **Aurous Blaze** on marked enemies.
