# Bennett

## **Roles:**

* **Main DPS**
* **Sub DPS**
* **Support** \(Healer, Buffer, Cleanser, Energy Battery\)

## **Character Breakdown:**

* Bennett is extremely versatile and can serve a variety of roles within a team.
* Elemental Skill changes based on whether it is tapped or held.
  * On tap, he deals an instance of Pyro Damage directly in front of him.
  * On hold, Bennett will begin charging.
    * At charge level two, he strikes twice and deals increased knockback.
    * At charge level three, he strikes thrice and triggers an ending explosion that launches both himself\* and the enemy.
      * Bennett's A4 passive prevents himself from being launched by this effect.
* Elemental Burst deals AoE Pyro damage and creates a field on the ground. Allies within this field gain the following effects:
  * If the active character is below 70% HP, regain HP until the character is at or above 70% HP
  * If the active character is above 70% HP, gain a flat ATK buff.
  * Periodically applies Pyro to the active character.
* Bennett's passives decrease the cooldown of his Elemental Skill.
  * At A4, the cooldown of the Elemental skill is decreased by 50% when cast inside of the field created by his Elemental Burst.

## **Additional Notes:**

* It is often not worth activating Bennett’s Constellation 6 as it limits his viability in many team comps.
* Bennett's healing will scale based on his Maximum HP, while his attack buff will scale based on his **Base ATK**. 
* Bennett's Constellation 1 allows him to buff ATK regardless of active character HP.
  * Bennett's Constellation 1 does **NOT** allow Bennett to continue healing past 70% HP.

* Bennett’s utility allows him to be placed in almost every single team comp. However, there are a few exceptions.

## **Does Not Work Well With**

\*\*\*\*![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_razor.png) ****

* Using Razor's Elemental Burst inside of Bennett's Elemental Burst will cause constant Overload reactions, which will knock smaller enemies away from Razor. However, Bennett can be used on larger enemies for additional damage.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_eula.png) 

* Since Eula’s Elemental Burst does not snapshot, the timing between dropping Bennett’s burst and Eula’s burst is very tight. It is also generally more useful to use Diona as a battery and healer for Eula rather than Bennett.

* Bennett will unfreeze frozen enemies, negating some of the Crit Rate bonuses available to Cryo Characters.

### **Main DPS Comps**

[Melt](../../teams/melt.md)

* Bennett’s short Elemental Skill cooldown and controllable pyro application allow him to consistently melt his Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst. 
* Chongyun's Elemental Skill allows Bennett to apply Cryo to enemies very consistently with his infused Normal Attacks.

[Overload](../../teams/overload.md)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_bennett.png)  ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_beidou.png)  ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_fischl.png)  ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_xingqiu.png) 

* The low cooldown of Bennett's Elemental Skill synergizes with the 4 piece effect of Thundering Fury, which can allow Bennett to have a 1-second cooldown on his elemental skill. 
* Beidou and Fischl apply Electro and deal damage, while Bennett both deals damage and generates particles with his shortened skill cooldown, allowing for lower Energy Recharge requirements on Beidou.
