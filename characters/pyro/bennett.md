# Bennett

## **Roles**

* **Support:** Healer, Buffer, Cleanser, Energy Battery
* **Main DPS**

## **Character Breakdown:**

* **Elemental Skill (Tap)** deals an instance of **Pyro** damage.&#x20;
* **Elemental Skill (Hold)** charges it up and do additional instance of damage and effects based on the charged level.
  * At **Charge level 1**, he strikes 2 times and launches small enemies.
  * At **Charge level 2**, he strikes 3 times and triggers an explosion at the end that launches both himself and the enemy.
* **Elemental Burst** deals **AoE** **Pyro** damage and creates a field on the ground. Allies within this field gain the following effects:
  * If the active character is below 70% **HP**, they regain **HP** until the character is at or above 70% **HP**
  * If the active character is above 70% **HP**, they gain a flat **Attack** buff.
  * Periodically applies **Pyro** to the active character.
* **A4** prevents Bennett from being launched by the explosion at the end of his charge level two **Elemental Skill** and reduces the cooldown of his **Elemental Skill** by 50% when cast inside the field created by his **Elemental Burst**.

## **Additional Notes:**

* **C1** allows him to buff **Attack** regardless of active character HP. It is worth noting that **C1** does not allow Bennett to continue healing past 70% HP.
* **C6** allows Bennett's **Elemental Burst** to infuse Sword, Claymore and Polearm-wielding characters' weapons with **Pyro**. This makes it often not worth activating Bennett’s **C6** as it limits his viability in many teams.
* Bennett's healing will scale based on his **Max HP,** while his **Attack** buff will scale based on his **Base Attack**.

* On **Freeze** teams Bennett will unfreeze frozen enemies, negating the **Critical Rate** bonus provided by **Cryo Resonance.**
  * This is not the case for **Cryo** teams that seek to utilize the **Melt** reaction instead.

### **Main DPS Teams**

****[**Melt (Pyro)**](../../teams/melt.md)****

* Bennett’s short **Elemental Skill** cooldown and controllable **Pyro** application allow him to consistently melt his **Elemental Skill** and **Elemental Burst**.
* Chongyun's **Elemental Skill** allows Bennett to apply **Cryo** to enemies with his infused **Normal Attacks**.

[**Overload**](../../teams/overload.md)****

* The low cooldown of Bennett's **Elemental Skill** benefits from the **Thundering Fury** 4-set effect, which can allow Bennett to have a 1 second cooldown on his **Elemental Skill.**
* Beidou and Fischl apply **Electro** and deal damage, while Bennett both deals damage and generates **Energy Particles** with his shortened skill cooldown. This allows for lower **Energy Recharge** requirements on Beidou.
