# Bennett

## **Roles**

* **Support:** Healer, Buffer, Cleanser, Energy Battery
* **Main DPS**

## **Character Breakdown:**

* **Elemental Skill (Tap)** deals an instance of **Pyro DMG**.
* **Elemental Skill (Hold)** charges this ability to deal additional instances of **Pyro DMG** and effects based on the charged level.
  * At **Charge level 1**, Bennett strikes 2 times and launches small enemies.
  * At **Charge level 2**, Bennett strikes 3 times and triggers an explosion at the end that launches both himself and the enemy.
* **Elemental Burst** deals **AoE** **Pyro DMG** and creates a field on the ground. Allies within this field gain the following effects:
  * If the active character is below 70% **HP**, they regain **HP** until the character is at or above 70% **HP**.
  * If the active character is above 70% **HP**, they gain a flat **ATK** buff.
  * Periodically applies **Pyro** to the active character.
* **A4** prevents Bennett from being launched by the explosion at the end of his charge level two **Elemental Skill** and reduces the cooldown of his **Elemental Skill** by 50% when cast inside the field created by his **Elemental Burst**.

## **Additional Notes:**

* **C1** allows him to buff **ATK** regardless of active character **HP**. **C1** does _**NOT**_ allow Bennett to continue healing past 70% **HP**.
* **C6** allows Bennett's **Elemental Burst** to infuse **Sword**, **Claymore** and **Polearm**-wielding characters' attacks with **Pyro**. Many players choose _**NOT**_ to unlock Bennett's **C6** as it can limit his viability in several teams.
* Bennett's healing will scale based on his **Max HP,** while his **ATK** buff will scale based on his **Base ATK**.

* Bennett’s utility allows him to be placed in almost every single team. However, there are a few exceptions.
  * E.g. Bennett is often not used with Hu Tao as this can complicate Hu Tao's **HP** management where maintaining her below 50% **HP** gives Hu Tao a buff.

* On **Freeze** teams, Bennett can **Melt Frozen** enemies, negating the **CRIT Rate** bonus provided by **Cryo Resonance** and the **Blizzard Strayer 4-Set**.
  * This is not the case for **Cryo** teams that specifically seek to utilize the **Melt** reaction instead.
