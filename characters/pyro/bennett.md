# Bennett

## **Roles**

* **Support:** Healer, Buffer, Cleanser, Energy Battery
* **Main DPS**

## **Character Breakdown:**

* Elemental Skill deals an instance of Pyro damage when tapped. Holding Elemental Skill charges it up and do additional instance of damage and effects based on the charged level.
  * At charge level one, he strikes twice and deals increased knockback.
  * At charge level two, he strikes thrice and triggers an explosion at the end that launches both himself and the enemy.
* Elemental Burst deals AoE Pyro damage and creates a field on the ground. Allies within this field gain the following effects:
  * If the active character is below 70% HP, regain HP until the character is at or above 70% HP
  * If the active character is above 70% HP, gain a flat ATK buff.
  * Periodically applies Pyro to the active character.

## **Additional Notes:**

* A4 prevents Bennett from being lunched by the explosion at the end of his charge level two Elemental Skill and reduce the cooldown of his Elemental Skill by 50% when cast inside the field created by his Elemental Burst.
* It is often not worth activating Bennett’s Constellation 6 as it limits his viability in many teams.
* Bennett's healing will scale based on his **Maximum HP,** while his attack buff will scale based on his **Base ATK**.
* Bennett's Constellation 1 allows him to buff ATK regardless of active character HP. It is worth noting that Constellation 1 does **NOT** allow Bennett to continue healing past 70% HP.

## Works Well With

* Bennett’s utility allows him to be placed in almost every single team. However, there are a few exceptions.

## **Does Not Work Well With**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Razor.png)

* Using Razor's Elemental Burst inside of Bennett's Elemental Burst will cause constant Overload reactions, which will knock smaller enemies away from Razor. However, the two can be used together on larger enemies for additional damage.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Eula.png)

* Since Eula’s Elemental Burst does not **snapshot**, the timing between dropping Bennett’s burst and Eula’s burst is very tight. It is also generally more useful to use Diona as a battery and healer for Eula rather than Bennett.

* Bennett will unfreeze frozen enemies, negating some of the Crit Rate bonuses available to Cryo Characters.

### **Main DPS Teams**

****[**Melt**](../../teams/melt.md)****

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Chongyun.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Sucrose.png)

* Bennett’s short Elemental Skill cooldown and controllable Pyro application allow him to consistently melt his Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst.
* Chongyun's Elemental Skill allows Bennett to apply Cryo to enemies very consistently with his infused Normal Attacks.

[**Overload**](../../teams/overload.md)****

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Beidou.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Fischl.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)

* The low cooldown of Bennett's Elemental Skill synergizes with the 4 piece effect of Thundering Fury, which can allow Bennett to have a 1-second cooldown on his Elemental Skill.
* Beidou and Fischl apply Electro and deal damage, while Bennett both deals damage and generates particles with his shortened skill cooldown. This allows for lower Energy Recharge requirements on Beidou.

### Support Teams

****[**Reverse Vaporize**](../../teams/reverse-vaporize.md)****

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Diluc.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Sucrose.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)

* In these teams, Bennett plays the role of healer, Pyro Resonance activator, and support.
* For teams with Xiangling, Bennett will also act as an Energy Battery and give Xiangling enough Energy to use her Elemental Burst more frequently.

****[**Geo**](../../teams/geo.md)****

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Ningguang.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Zhongli.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xiangling.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)

* In these Teams, Bennett plays the role of healer, Pyro Resonance activator, and support.

****[**Electro-Charged**](../../teams/electro-charged.md)****

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Beidou.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Fischl.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)

* In these teams, Bennett plays the role of healer and support.
* The difference between this team and the Overload Main-DPS team is Bennett is no longer built as the damage focus.

**​**[**National Team**](https://genshinteambuilds.gitbook.io/teams/teams/other)** **​

​ ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xiangling.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Chongyun.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)

* This is a variant of the Reverse Vaporize team which is popular in China.
* In this team, Bennett plays the role of healer, Pyro Resonance activator, support, and Sub-DPS.
* Xiangling and Xingqiu's Elemental Bursts persist Off-Field, letting Bennett easily act as an Energy Battery for Xiangling.

****[**Oneshot**](broken-reference/)****

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_tartaglia.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Mona.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Sucrose.png)

* Bennett can act as a healer, Pyro resonance activator, and support in these teams.
* Bennett is highly valued in Oneshot teams due to his easily accessible Attack buff and Pyro application.
