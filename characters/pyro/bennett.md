# Bennett

## **Roles:**

* **Main DPS**
* **Sub DPS**
* **Support** \(Healer, Buffer, Cleanser, Energy Battery\)

## **Character Breakdown:**

* Normal Attack: Strike of Fortune: Bennett has a 5 string auto attack sequence, dealing phys damage unless infused with another element.
* Passion Overload: Bennett’s elemental skill has a tap sequence, where he unleashes a single swipe dealing pyro damage. His elemental skill can also be held to charge up and release consecutive attacks of pyro damage.
* Fantastic Voyage: Bennett’s elemental burst deals AoE pyro damage upon activation and leaves behind a field. While Allies are inside the field, they will be periodically healed and afflicted with the pyro element. Bennett’s elemental burst also provides a flat attack buff when ally members are above 70% hp.
* Bennett’s first ascension talent, Rekindle, decreases his elemental skill cooldown by 20%.
* Bennett’s second ascension talent, Fearnaught, decreases the cooldown of his elemental skill while inside his burst by 50%, and will prevent knockback taken from a level 2 charged elemental skill.

## **Additional Notes:**

* It is often not worth activating Bennett’s Constellation 6 as it limits his viability in many team comps.

* Bennett’s utility allows him to be placed in almost every single team comp. However, there are a few exceptions.

## **Does Not Work Well With**

\*\*\*\*![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_razor.png) ****

* Bennett does not work well with Razor because Bennett will continuously infuse Razor with pyro. However, Razor infuses himself with electro, leading to constant overload procs and knocking away enemies.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_eula.png) 

* Since Eula’s ult does not snapshot, the timing between dropping Bennett’s burst and Eula’s burst is very tight. It is also generally more useful to use Diona as a battery for Eula rather than Bennett.

* Bennett will unfreeze frozen enemies, resetting the 4p blizzard strayer effect on freeze team compositions.
