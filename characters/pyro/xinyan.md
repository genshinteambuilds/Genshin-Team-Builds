# Xinyan

## Roles

* **Support:** Shielder, Cleanser, Buffer (A4), Debuffer (C4)
* **Burst DPS:** (C2)

## Character Breakdown

* **Elemental Skill** deals **Pyro** Damage, applies **Pyro** to Xinyan, and creates a shield. The Shield's Damage Absorption varies depending on how many opponents are hit by the **Elemental Skill**.
  * Hitting 0â€“1 opponents grants Shield Level 1: **Ad Lib**.
  * Hitting 2 opponents grants Shield Level 2: **Lead-In**.
  * Hitting 3 or more opponents grants Shield Level 3: **Rave**, which also deals **Pyro** damage to nearby enemies.
* **Elemental Burst** launches nearby opponents and deals **Physical** damage followed by periodic **Pyro** Damage around her.
* **A2** decreases the number of enemies the **Elemental Skill** must hit to trigger that level of shielding. This means that after reaching this **Ascension** level, Xinyan will always trigger at least Shield Level 2: **Lead In**.
* **A4** makes characters shielded by Xinyan's **Elemental Skill** deal 15% increased **Physical** damage.

## Additional Notes

* Often used as a **Physical** Support but lacks the ability to trigger **Superconduct**, making her a less desirable choice than **Electro** / **Cryo**-based **Physical** Supports.
* Can be used to cleanse the active character with her shield which momentarily applies **Pyro**. Swapping to another character while the shield is active will also cleanse that character as well.
* **C4** allows Xinyan's **Elemental Skill** to debuff enemy **Physical Resistance** by 15% for 12 seconds.

## Works Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Razor.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Eula.png)

* Eula and Razor are both **Physical** Main DPS that can benefit from Xinyan's Shield and **Physical** Damage related Debuffs.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)

* Bennett is able to pair with Xinyan nicely to provide Healing, Shielding, Buffs / Debuffs and **Pyro Resonance**. This may potentially cause issues in Razor teams specifically though due to constantly causing **Overload Elemental Reactions**.

## Does Not Work Well With

* Unless a team has a **Physical** Main DPS, Xinyan provides little as a Support.
