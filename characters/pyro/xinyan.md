# Xinyan

## Roles

* **Support:** Shielder, Cleanser, Debuffer \(Constellation 4\)
* **Burst DPS** \(Constellation 2+\)

## Character Breakdown

* Elemental skill deals Pyro Damage, applies Pyro to Xinyan, and creates a Shield. 
  * Hitting 0â€“1 opponents grants Shield Level 1: Ad Lib.
  * Hitting 2 opponents grants Shield Level 2: Lead-In.
  * Hitting 3 or more opponents grants Shield Level 3: Rave, which also deals intermittent Pyro Damage to nearby enemies.
* Elemental Burst launches nearby opponents and deals Physical Damage followed by Pyro DoT around her. 
* Ascension 2 Talent decreases the amount of opponent's hit by Elemental Skill needed by 1.
* Ascension 4 Talent: characters shielded by Xinyan's Elemental Skill deal 15% increased Physical Damage.

## Additional Notes

* Often used as a Physical Support but lacks the ability to trigger Superconduct, making her a less desirable choice than Electro/Cryo-based Physical Supports.

## Works Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_razor.png) 

* Razor is a traditional Physical Main DPS that can benefit from Xinyan's Shield and Physical Damage related Debuffs. 

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_eula.png) 

* Eula, similar to Razor, is able to benefit from Xinyan's Shield and Physical Damage related Debuffs.

* Bennett is able to pair with Xinyan nicely to provide Healing, Shielding, Buffs/Debuffs and Pyro Resonance to any Physical Main DPS.

* Unless a team has a Physical Main DPS, Xinyan provides little as a Support.
