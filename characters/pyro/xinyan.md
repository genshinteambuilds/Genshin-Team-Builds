# Xinyan

## Roles

* **Support:** Shielder, Cleanser, Buffer (A4), Debuffer (C4)
* **Burst DPS:** (C2)

## Character Breakdown

* **Elemental Skill** deals **Pyro** **DMG**, applies **Pyro** to Xinyan, and creates a shield. The Shield's damage absorption varies depending on how many opponents are hit by the **Elemental Skill**.
  * Hitting 0â€“1 opponents grants Shield Level 1: **Ad Lib**.
  * Hitting 2 opponents grants Shield Level 2: **Lead-In**.
  * Hitting 3 or more opponents grants Shield Level 3: **Rave**, which also deals **Pyro** **DMG** to nearby enemies.
* **Elemental Burst** launches nearby opponents and deals **Physical** **DMG** followed by periodic **Pyro** **DMG** around her.
* **A2** decreases the number of enemies the **Elemental Skill** must hit to trigger that level of shielding. This means that after reaching this **Ascension** level, Xinyan will always trigger at least Shield Level 2: **Lead In**.
* **A4** makes characters shielded by Xinyan's **Elemental Skill** deal 15% increased **Physical** **DMG**.

## Additional Notes

* Often used as a **Physical** Support but lacks the ability to trigger **Superconduct**, making her a less desirable choice than **Electro** / **Cryo**-based **Physical** Supports.
* Can be used to cleanse the active character with her shield which momentarily applies **Pyro**. Swapping to another character while the shield is active will also cleanse that character as well.
* **C4** allows Xinyan's **Elemental Skill** to debuff enemy **Physical RES** by 15% for 12 seconds.

## Works Well With

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_razor.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_eula.png)

* Eula and Razor are both **Physical** Main DPS that can benefit from Xinyan's shield and **Physical** **DMG** related debuffs.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_bennett.png)

* Bennett is able to pair with Xinyan nicely to provide healing, shielding, buffs / debuffs and **Pyro Resonance**. This may potentially cause issues in Razor teams specifically though due to constantly causing **Overload Elemental Reactions**.

## Does Not Work Well With

* Unless a team has a **Physical** Main DPS, Xinyan provides little as a Support.
