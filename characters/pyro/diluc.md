# Diluc

## Roles

* **Main DPS**

## Character Breakdown

* **Elemental Skill** deals **Pyro DMG** and can be used 3 times before going on cooldown.
* **Elemental Burst** deals **Pyro DMG** and knocks back enemies in a wide **AoE**.
* **Elemental Burst** infuses Diluc's Weapon with **Pyro**.
  * **A4** allows him to reach 100% uptime with the **Pyro** infusion from his **Elemental Burst**.

## **Additional Notes**

* **Elemental Skill** can be animation cancelled with Diluc's **Normal Attack**
  * Diluc's typical **Elemental Skill** + **Normal Attack** chain is as follows:
    * `NA → E → NA → E → NA → E → NA`
    * where: `NA` = **Normal Attack** and `E` = **Elemental Skill**
* Diluc can be paired with Chongyun early in the game to create a **Melt** team with Diluc using 2 **Normal Attacks** per **Elemental Skill** usage while standing within Chongyun's **Cryo** field.
  * This does not work correctly once Diluc's **Normal Attacks** are infused with **Pyro** from his **Elemental Burst**. This team composition is typically abandoned once you reach a later stage in the game for this reason.
* Diluc cannot **Melt** enemies that are **Frozen** as his **Claymore** weapon type causes **Shatter** instead.

## Works Well With

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_xingqiu.png)

* Diluc is almost always paired with Xingqiu in order to allow Diluc to **Vaporize** his attacks for 1.5x more **DMG**. Check the [**Vaporize (Pyro)**](../../teams/reverse-vaporize.md) team page for team compositions and notes.

* As with all **Elemental DMG** DPS characters, **Anemo** supports and Zhongli works well by reducing the enemies' **Elemental RES** with **Viridescent Venerer** 4-set or Zhongli's Jade Shield. **Anemo** characters often also supply useful Crowd Control abilities or other buffs.
* Bennett's **Elemental Burst** provides healing and a massive **ATK** buff, making him a staple character in most teams.

## Does Not Work Well With

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_icon\_cryo.webp)

* **Melt** teams using Diluc typically do not work well due to the inability of most **Cryo** supports to apply **Cryo** aura fast enough so that Diluc will be the character causing the **Melt** **reaction** and benefiting from the **DMG** amplification.
* **Melt** teams can work early in the game due to Diluc having much lower uptime on his **Elemental Burst** and **Pyro** infusion but generally fall off the further into the game as you progress.
* **Melt** teams can sometimes still work if enough **Cryo** applying sources are added to the team such as Ayaka's **Elemental Burst** + Ganyu's **Elemental Burst** but this is often not practical and isn't recommended.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_icon\_electro.webp)

* **Electro** supports generally do not work well with Diluc as the **Overload** **reaction** causes enemies to be knocked back out of Diluc's melee range.
* **Overload** teams can work early in the game. Unfortunately, the downside of knocking back enemies along with **Overload** scaling falling off in the late game result in these teams falling further and further behind as you progress in the game.

* **Physical** **DMG** based characters do not synergize with Diluc's **Pyro** **DMG**.
