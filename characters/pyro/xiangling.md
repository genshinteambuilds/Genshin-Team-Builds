# Xiangling

## Roles

* **Off-Field DPS**
* **Main DPS**
* **Support:** Buffer (C6), Debuffer (C1)

## Character Breakdown

* **Elemental Skill** summons Gouba, an NPC that deals four instances of **Pyro** damage over a few seconds and will remain on the field even without Xiangling.
  * **A4** causes Gouba to drop to a chili upon disappearing. The chili buffs the **Attack** of any character that collects it by 10%.
* **Elemental Burst** creates a **Pyro** whirlwind that circles around your character, dealing **Pyro** damage whenever it comes in contact with an enemy. Like her **Elemental Skill**, it persists even when Xiangling is not on the field.

## Additional Notes

* **Elemental Burst** snapshots any character buffs Xiangling receives when activating the ability for its entire duration.
* **Elemental Skill** is not very good at generating **Elemental Particles,** and her **Elemental Burst** has a very high cost. Xiangling is almost always paired with a **Pyro Energy Battery** (typically Bennett) for this reason.
* Xiangling’s kit makes her an exceptional duo with almost any **Cryo** or **Hydro** characters, enabling consistent **Melts** or **Vaporize** reactions from her constant **Pyro** application.
* **C1** debuffs **Pyro Resistance** on enemies when they are hit by **Guoba**'s attacks.
* **C4** increases the duration of her **Elemental Burst**. This greatly increases her total damage output.
* **C6** buffs the entire team's **Pyro** damage when her **Elemental Burst** is active.
  * The buff does not apply to Xiangling as her **Elemental Burst** snapshots and only activates after it's been cast.

## Works Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Ganyu.png)

* Ganyu and Xiangling is a standard pairing for **Melt Elemental Reactions**, Xiangling’s frequent **Pyro** application can enable Ganyu’s **Charged Attacks** to consistently **Melt** for large amounts of damage.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Tartaglia.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)

* While Tartaglia is played as the Main DPS character when paired with Xiangling, he effectively ends up applying **Hydro** constantly on enemies and causing Xiangling’s abilities to trigger **Vaporize Elemental Reactions**.
* Childe and Xingqiu apply so much **Hydro** that all of Xiangling’s abilities can consistently **Vaporize** for 1.5x more damage off of them.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)

* Bennett acts as both an Energy Battery and as a damage buffer for Xiangling, giving her a large **Attack** both buff from his **Elemental Burst** and from **Pyro Resonance** which will snapshot into Xiangling’s **Elemental Burst.**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Anemo.webp)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Zhongli.png)

* As with all **Elemental Damage** DPS characters, **Anemo** supports and Zhongli works well by reducing the enemies' **Elemental Resistance** with **Viridescent Venerer** 4-set or Zhongli's **Jade Shield**. **Anemo** characters often also supply useful Crowd Control abilities or other buffs.

## Does Not Work Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Razor.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Eula.png)

* Xiangling is generally not useful in teams that focus on **Physical** damage as she does not help with providing **Superconduct**.&#x20;

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Hutao.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Diluc.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Yanfei.png)

* These **Pyro** Main DPS characters typically want to create **Vaporize** and **Melt** Reactions, and while Xiangling can provide some decent buffs for her from Constellations, Xiangling will end up overwhelming the **Hydro** or **Cryo** application from your other Support characters when used alongside these **Pyro** characters.

* This team focuses on enabling Ganyu to deal massive damage through **Melt** reactions provided from Xiangling’s **Pyro** application.
* Bennett acts as an Energy Battery in order to recharge Xiangling's **Elemental Burst**.

****[**National**](../../teams/national.md)****

* This team will have Xiangling dealing the bulk of its damage with the **Hydro** character applying **Hydro** to the enemy and allowing Xiangling’s **Elemental Burst** to **Vaporize**.
