# Xiangling

## Roles

* **Off-Field DPS**
* **Main DPS**
* **Support:** Buffer (C6), Debuffer (C1)

## Character Breakdown

* Elemental Skill summons a pet that deals four instances of Pyro Damage over a few seconds and will remain on the field even without Xiangling.
* Elemental Burst creates a Pyro whirlwind that circles around your character for a few seconds, dealing Pyro Damage whenever it comes in contact with an enemy and like her Elemental Skill, it persists even with Xiangling is not on the field.
* Xiangling’s kit makes her an exceptional duo for almost any Cryo or Hydro DPS, enabling consistent Melts or Vaporize procs from her constant Pyro application.
* Xiangling herself also deals very considerable damage and it is a strong option to utilize her as the bulk of your damage in many comps, even from off-field and not simply as an elemental aura support.

## Additional Notes

* Xiangling’s Elemental Burst snapshots any character buffs for its entire duration.
* Elemental Skill is not very good at generating Elemental Particles and her Burst has a very high cost, using a battery is typically advised.

## Works Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI_AvatarIcon_Ganyu.png)

* Ganyu and Xiangling is a standard pairing for Melt combos, Xiangling’s frequent Pyro application can enable Ganyu’s Charged Attacks to consistently Melt for extreme damage.

* While Tartaglia is played as the main DPS when paired with Xiangling, he effectively ends up being the support in this composition, applying constant Hydro auras and causing Xiangling’s abilities to consistently Vaporize.

* Bennett acts as both a battery and a massive damage amp for Xiangling, giving her a large chunk of Attack both from his Burst and from Pyro Resonance which will snapshot into Xiangling’s Burst.

* As with all Elemental Damage DPS, Anemo supports and Zhongli work well by reducing the enemy's Elemental Resistance with Viridescent Venerer or Zhongli's Jade Shield. Anemo characters often also supply useful Crowd Control abilities or other buffs.

## Does Not Work Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI_AvatarIcon_Razor.png)

* Razor prefers constant Superconduct uptime and likes to keep in close quarters with his opponent to deal DPS, with Xiangling, Razor will end up causing frequent Overloads which can fly enemies out of your DPS range.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI_AvatarIcon_Hutao.png)

* Hu Tao is another Pyro character who typically wants to benefit from all the multiplicative reactions she can get, and while Xiangling can provide some decent buffs for her from Constellations, she will end up stealing a lot of Vaporize and Melt procs from Hu Tao.
