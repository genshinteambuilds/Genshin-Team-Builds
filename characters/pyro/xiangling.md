# Xiangling

## Roles

* **Off-Field DPS**
* **Main DPS**
* **Support:** Buffer (C6), Debuffer (C1)

## Character Breakdown

* **Elemental Skill** summons a pet that deals four instances of **Pyro** Damage over a few seconds and will remain on the field even without Xiangling.
* **Elemental Burst** creates a **Pyro** whirlwind that circles around your character for a few seconds, dealing **Pyro** Damage whenever it comes in contact with an enemy and like her **Elemental Skill**, it persists even with Xiangling is not on the field.
* **A4** makes Guoba drop a chili which buffs the **Attack** of any character that collects it by 10%.

## Additional Notes

* Xiangling’s **Elemental Burst** "snapshots" any character buffs for its entire duration.
* **Elemental Skill** is not very good at generating **Elemental Particles** and her **Burst** has a very high cost, using an Energy Battery is typically advised.
* Xiangling’s kit makes her an exceptional duo for almost any **Cryo** or **Hydro** DPS, enabling consistent **Melts** or **Vaporize** procs from her constant **Pyro** application.
* Xiangling herself also deals very considerable damage and it is a strong option to utilize her as the bulk of your damage in many comps, even from off-field and not simply as an elemental aura support.
* **C1** debuffs **Pyro Resistance** on Enemies when they are hit by Guoba's attacks.
* **C4** increases the duration of her **Elemental Burst** which greatly increase her total damage output.
* **C6** buffs the **Pyro** damage of all characters when her **Elemental Burst** is active.
  * The buff does not apply to Xiangling as her **Elemental Burst** snapshots and only activates after it's been cast.

## Works Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Ganyu.png)

* Ganyu and Xiangling is a standard pairing for **Melt** combos, Xiangling’s frequent **Pyro** application can enable Ganyu’s **Charged Attacks** to consistently **Melt** for extreme damage.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_tartaglia.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)

* While Tartaglia is played as the main DPS when paired with Xiangling, he effectively ends up being the support in this composition, applying constant **Hydro** auras and causing Xiangling’s abilities to consistently **Vaporize**.
  * Childe and Xingqiu have a high rate of **Hydro** application which allows all of Xiangling’s abilities to consistently **Vaporize** for 1.5x more damage.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)

* Bennett acts as both a Energy battery and as a Damage Buffer for Xiangling, giving her a large **Attack** both buff from his **Elemental Burst** and from **Pyro Resonance** which will snapshot into Xiangling’s **Elemental Burst.**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Anemo.webp)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Zhongli.png)

* As with all Elemental Damage DPS, **Anemo** supports and Zhongli work well by reducing the enemy's **Elemental Resistance** with **Viridescent Venerer** or Zhongli's Jade Shield. **Anemo** characters often also supply useful Crowd Control abilities or other buffs.

## Does Not Work Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Razor.png)

* Razor prefers constant **Superconduct** uptime and likes to keep in close quarters with his opponent to deal DPS, with Xiangling, Razor will end up causing frequent **Overloads** which can fly enemies out of your DPS range.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Hutao.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Diluc.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Yanfei.png)

* These **Pyro** DPS characters typically want to create **Vaporize** and **Melt** Reactions, and while Xiangling can provide some decent buffs for her from Constellations, she will end up stealing a lot of **Vaporize** and **Melt** reactions which can hinder their damage output.

* This team focuses on enabling Ganyu to deal massive damage through **Melt r**eactions provided from Xiangling’s **Pyro** application. It is recommended to build her with Energy Recharge to frequently cast her **Elemental Burst**.
* Kazuha debuffs enemies **Pyro Resistance** with **Viridescent Venerer**, and buffs Xiangling **Pyro** Damage at the same time with his **A4.**
* Bennett acts as the team's healer while providing an **Attack** buff from his **Elemental Burst** and **Pyro Resonance**.
