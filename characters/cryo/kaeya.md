# Kaeya

## Roles

* **Off-Field DPS** (Elemental Burst)
* **Support**: Energy Battery
* **Main DPS**

## Character Breakdown

* **Elemental Skill **shoots a cone of **Cryo **Damage in front of him, healing him based off of his attack and generating a middling amount of **energy particles**.
* **Elemental Bursts **summons **3 icicles **that revolve around the character on field for 15 seconds, dealing **Cryo **Damage to targets they hit.
* **A4 **allows his **Elemental Skill **to generate additional **Cryo **energy particles whenever enemies are **frozen **by it.

## Additional Notes

* His **Utility Passive **decreases sprinting **Stamina Consumption **by 20%, allowing for slightly more dodging ability** **especially with stamina intensive **Charged Attack **Characters.
* Combination of decent **energy generation **and **Energy Recharge** as an ascension stat allows Kaeya to be able to build heavily into damage and still be able to support his own **Elemental Burst**, especially in **Freeze** team compositions.
* **C2 **increases the duration of his Elemental Burst.&#x20;
* **C6 **adds an additional icicle to the burst and refunding a portion of the Elemental Burst cost.

## Works Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Cryo.webp)

* Off-Field DPS capabilities pair well with other **Cryo **Main DPS to add additional **Cryo **application and damage to teams.
* Kaeya's high energy generation allows him to work as a powerful energy battery for other **Cryo **Main DPS, especially in **Freeze **teams.
* **Cryo Resonance **as a whole is very powerful in teams which constantly apply the element.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Pyro.webp)

* Kaeya's high frequency **Cryo **application and relatively high damage on his **Elemental Burst **allows him to function in both [**Melt (Pyro) **](../../teams/melt.md)and [**Melt (Cryo)**](../../teams/reverse-melt.md)** **teams.

* Characters with high **Hydro** application paired with Kaeya enables **Freeze**.
* Kaeya's energy generation is greatly boosted when he applies **Freeze **with his **Elemental Skill**.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Anemo.webp)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Zhongli.png)

* Kaeya's large amount of AoE damage is highly effective when paired with** **Crowd Control, especially when in comps not utilizing **Freeze**.
* Similarly to all **Elemental **Damage focused characters, Kaeya benefits greatly from the **Elemental Resistance** debuff provided by **Anemo **supports using **Viridescent Venerer** set and Zhongli's shield.

## Does Not Work Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Electro.webp)

* Barring **Physical **damage characters, **Superconduct **falls behind other Elemental Reactions in terms of damage.
* **Physical **teams can still use Kaeya as well as an **Electro **character to easily trigger **Superconduct **from off field.

* While Tartaglia can function in **Freeze **teams, especially with higher **constellations**, he's typically better used with other **elements**.

[**Freeze **](../../teams/freeze.md)****

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Kaeya.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Chongyun.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Barbara.png)

* Kaeya's energy generation in **Freeze**-based teams is massive, able to support other **Cryo **characters with very little Energy Recharge.
* Kaeya can be used as a Main DPS in Freeze teams, especially in combination with Chongyun. Chongyun's **Cryo Infusion **of **Normal Attacks **allows Kaeya to utilize his high **Normal **and **Charged Attack **damage while still gaining **Elemental Damage **bonuses.
* Typically these teams will utilize Kaeya and another **Cryo **DPS, as **Cryo Resonance **is extremely powerful and easy to upkeep in this team.
* The combination of the **Blizzard Strayer** set and **Cryo Resonance **can give Kaeya massive amounts of **Critical Rate **with no further investment.

****[**Melt (Pyro)**](../../teams/melt.md)****

****![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Hutao.png)****![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)****![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Kaeya.png)****![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Diona.png)****

* Kaeya will can be fit into a **Vaporize **team to allow triggers of the higher-damage **Melt **reaction in addition to standard **Vaporizes**.
* Kaeya alone cannot produce enough **Cryo **application to **Melt **every attack from a **Pyro **Main DPS. Pairing with either another **Hydro **or **Cryo **character is necessary to maximize damage.
* Due to **Cryo **overwriting **Hydro**, Off-Field DPS of both elements can be used simultaneously with the higher damage reaction being used whenever available.
* Kaeya's increased **Cryo **application at **C6 **can increase the frequency at which this team can trigger **Melt**.

[**Physical**](../../teams/physical.md)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Razor.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Kaeya.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Fischl.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Zhongli.png)

* Kaeya's **Elemental Burst **following the active character allows for consistent **Superconduct **Applications.
* In teams with Eula, Kaeya can be used to provide both **Cryo **Resonance and increased energy regeneration.

[**Melt (Cryo)**](../../teams/reverse-melt.md)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Rosaria.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xiangling.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Kaeya.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)

* This team is based around frequently applying **Pyro **to enemies and then using Off-Field **Cryo **DPS to cause **Melt **reactions.
* Given frequent enough **Pyro **application, both Kaeya and Rosaria's damage can trigger **Melt.**
* **Melt (Cryo) **teams may lack team flexibility, as they rely on the Elemental applications of multiple characters.
