# Kaeya

## Roles

* **Off-Field DPS** (Elemental Burst)
* **Support**: Energy Battery
* **Main DPS**

## Character Breakdown

* **Elemental Skill** deals **Cryo DMG** in a cone in front of Kaeya, also healing him slightly based on Kaeya's **ATK**.
  * **A4** allows his **Elemental Skill** to generate additional **Cryo** energy particles whenever enemies are **Frozen** by it.
* **Elemental Burst** summons **3 icicles** that revolve around the character on field for 15 seconds, dealing **Cryo DMG** to any targets they hit.

## Additional Notes

* Kaeya's **Utility Passive** decreases sprinting **Stamina** consumption by 20%, allowing for slightly more dodging ability especially with **Stamina** intensive **Charged Attack** Characters.
* Combination of decent **Energy Particle** generation and **Energy Recharge** as an ascension stat allows Kaeya to be able to build heavily into damage stats and still be able to support his own **Elemental Burst**, especially in **Freeze** team compositions.
* **C2** increases the duration of his **Elemental Burst**.
* **C6** adds an additional icicle to the **Elemental Burst** and refunds a portion of the energy cost.

## Works Well With

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Cryo.webp)

* Off-Field DPS capabilities pair well with other **Cryo** Main DPS to add additional **Cryo** application and damage to teams.
* Kaeya's high **Energy Particle** generation allows him to work as a powerful Energy Battery for other **Cryo** Main DPS, especially in [**Freeze** ](../../teams/freeze.md)teams.
* **Cryo Resonance** as a whole is very powerful in teams which constantly apply the element.

* Characters with high **Hydro** application paired with Kaeya enables [**Freeze** ](../../teams/freeze.md)teams.

## Does Not Work Well With

* **Geo** **DMG** shatters **Frozen** enemies making these characters not ideal in [**Freeze** ](../../teams/freeze.md)teams.
* **Geo** can be used with **Cryo** if you do not intend to **Freeze** enemies.

## Teams

{% endhint %}

[**Melt (Cryo)**](../../teams/reverse-melt.md)

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Rosaria.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xiangling.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Kaeya.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)

* This team is based around frequently applying **Pyro** to enemies and then using Off-Field **Cryo** DPS to cause **Melt** reactions.
* Given frequent enough **Pyro** application, both Kaeya and Rosaria's **Cryo DMG** can trigger **Melt.**
* [**Melt (Cryo)**](../../teams/reverse-melt.md) teams may lack team flexibility, as they rely on the Elemental applications of multiple characters.

[**Physical (Electro)**](../../teams/physical.md)

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Razor.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Kaeya.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Fischl.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Zhongli.png)

* Kaeya's **Elemental Burst** following the active character allows for consistent **Superconduct** applications.
* In teams with Eula, Kaeya can be used to provide both **Cryo Resonance** and act as an Energy Battery.

[**Freeze (Cryo)**](../../teams/freeze.md)

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Ayaka.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Kaeya.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Jean.png)

* Kaeya provides **Cryo Resonance** and extra **Cryo** application.
* As Ayaka is Energy hungry, Kaeya's A4 to generate more **Cryo Energy Particles** is valuable to her.
* Jean gives healing and **Viridescent Venerer** debuff.

### Character Specific Teams

**Freeze (w/ Chongyun)**

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Kaeya.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Chongyun.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Sayu.png)

* Kaeya plays the role of the On-field Main DPS in this team with his **Normal Attacks** and **Charged Attacks** infused with **Cryo** thanks to Chongyun's **Elemental Skill.**
* Xingqiu's **Elemental Burst** applies **Hydro** to allow this team to **Freeze** enemies.
* Sayu provides healing and the **Viridescent Venerer** debuff.

{% hint style="info" %}
Possible substitutions:

* Xingqiu can be substitued for Kokomi, Mona or any other source of Off-field **Hydro** application.
* Sayu can be replaced with any Healer or Shielder or another **Anemo** support character if healing is not required.
