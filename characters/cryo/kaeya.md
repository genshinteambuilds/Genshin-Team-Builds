# Kaeya

## Roles

* **Off-Field DPS** (Elemental Burst)
* **Support**: Energy Battery
* **Main DPS**

## Character Breakdown

* Elemental Skill shoots a cone of Cryo Damage in front of him, healing him based off of his attack and generating a middling amount of energy particles.
* Elemental Bursts summons 3 icicles that revolve around the character on field for 15 seconds, dealing Cryo Damage to targets they hit.
* His second passive allows his Elemental Skill to generate additional Cryo energy particles (to a maximum of 2 per use), whenever enemies are frozen by it.

## Additional Notes

* His passive decreases sprinting stamina consumption by 20%, allowing for slightly more dodging ability especially with Stamina intensive Charged Attack Characters.
* Combination of decent energy generation and Energy Recharge% as an ascension stat allows Kaeya to be able to build heavily into damage and still be able to support his own Elemental Burst, especially in Freeze-based team compositions.
* Both C2 and C6 provide substantial damage and upkeep power increases, with C2 situationally increasing the duration and C6 adding an additional icicle to the burst and refunding a portion of the cost.
* Constellations are more difficult to acquire than other 4 star characters, due to only being available in the monthly Starglitter shop and Standard Banner.

## Works Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Cryo.webp)

* Off-Field DPS capabilities pair well with other Cryo Main DPS to add additional Cryo application and damage to team compositions.
* Kaeya's high energy generation allows him to work as a powerful energy battery for other Cryo Main DPS, especially in Freeze teams.
* Cryo Resonance as a whole is very powerful in teams which constantly apply the element.

* Kaeya's high frequency Cryo application and relatively high damage on his Elemental Burst allows him to function in both Melt and Reverse Melt teams.

* Characters with high Hydro application paired with Kaeya enable easy Freeze.
* Kaeya's energy generation is greatly boosted when he applies Freeze with his Elemental Skill.

* Kaeya's large amount of Area of Affect damage is highly effective when paired with Crowd Control, especially when in comps not utilizing Freeze.
* Similarly to all Elemental Damage focused characters, Kaeya benefits greatly from the Elemental resistance shred provided by Anemo supports and Zhongli.

## Does Not Work Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Electro.webp)

* Barring Physical damage characters, Superconduct falls behind other Elemental Reactions in terms of damage.
* Physical Damage teams can still use Kaeya as well as an Electro character to easily trigger Superconduct from off field.

* While Tartaglia can function in Freeze teams, especially with higher constellations, he's typically better used with other elements.

[**Freeze **](../../teams/freeze.md)****

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Kaeya.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Chongyun.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Barbara.png)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Ayaka.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Kaeya.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Zhongli.png)

* Kaeya's energy generation in Freeze-based teams is massive, able to support other Cryo characters with very little Energy Recharge.
* Kaeya can be used as a Main DPS in Freeze comps, especially in combination with Chongyun. Chongyun's Cryo conversion of Normal Attacks allows Kaeya to utilize his high Normal and Charged Attack damage while still gaining Elemental Damage bonuses.
* Typically these teams will utilize Kaeya and another Cryo DPS, as Cryo resonance is extremely powerful and easy to upkeep in this team.
* The combination of the Blizzard Strayer artifact set and Cryo Resonance can give Kaeya massive amounts of Critical Strike chance with no further investment.

[**Physical**](../../teams/physical.md)

* Kaeya's burst following the active character allows for consistent Superconduct Applications.
* In teams with Eula, Kaeya can be used to provide both Cryo Resonance and increased energy regeneration.

[**Melt**](../../teams/melt.md)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Hutao.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Kaeya.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Jean.png)

* Kaeya will can be fit into a Vaporize team to allow triggers of the higher-damage Melt reaction in addition to standard Vaporizes.
* Kaeya alone cannot produce enough Cryo application to Melt every attack from a Pyro Main DPS. Pairing with either a Hydro or Cryo character is necessary to maximize damage.
* Due to Cryo overwriting Hydro, Off-Field DPS of both elements can be used simultaneously with the higher damage reaction being used whenever available.
* Kaeya's increased Cryo application at C6 can increase the frequency at which this comp can trigger Melt.

[**Reverse Melt**](../../teams/reverse-melt.md)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Rosaria.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xiangling.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Kaeya.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)

* This team is based around frequently applying Pyro to enemies and then using Off-Field Cryo DPS to cause Melts.
* Given frequent enough Pyro application, both Kaeya and Rosaria's damage can be Melted.
* Reverse Melt teams may lack a flex slot, as they rely on the Elemental applications of multiple characters.
