# Kaeya

## Roles

* Sub DPS \(Burst\)

## Character Breakdown

* Elemental skill shoots a cone of Cryo Damage in front of him.
* Elemental Bursts summons 3 icicles that revolves around the current character, dealing Cryo Damage to the target it hits.
* His first passive heals himself for 15% of his attack for every hit with his elemental skill.
* His second passive allows his elemental skill to generate additional elemental particles \(to a maximum of 2 per use\), whenever enemies are frozen by it.

## Additional Notes

* His passive decreases sprinting stamina consumption by 20%, which is useful in some circumstances.
* His C2 is useful in extending his elemental bursts duration whenever it kills an opponent \(by 2.5s to a max of 15s\).

## Works Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/element_cryo.webp) 

* Works well to activate cryo resonance, which is good for freeze teams.
* Kaeya can also be a battery for main cryo dps like Eula/Ayaka/Ganyu

* Xingqiu’s Elemental Skill and Burst help to protect Kaeya and works well in a freeze team.
* Barbara can fill the healer role and provide some hydro application for freeze comps.

* You crowd control them into an area for Kaeya to infuse cryo reactions.
* Jean can swirl enemies together for elemental application.

* Zhongli has the best shield for off-field protection, and reduces both enemy elemental and physical resistance for extra dmg.

## Does Not Work Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/element_electro.webp) 

* Unless building a physical based comp with Kaeya \(which isn’t recommended\), don’t pair him with electro characters

* While C4 Tartaglia can work with freeze teams, it’s too costly to work for most circumstances.
