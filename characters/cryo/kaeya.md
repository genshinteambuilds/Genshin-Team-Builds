# Kaeya

## Roles

* **Off-Field DPS** (Elemental Burst)
* **Support**: Energy Battery
* **Main DPS**

## Character Breakdown

* **Elemental Skill** deals **Cryo Damage** in a cone in front of Kaeya, also healing him slightly based on Kaeya's **Attack**.
  * **A4** allows his **Elemental Skill** to generate additional **Cryo** energy particles whenever enemies are **Frozen** by it.
* **Elemental Burst** summons **3 icicles** that revolve around the character on field for 15 seconds, dealing **Cryo** Damage to any targets they hit.

## Additional Notes

* Kaeya's **Utility Passive** decreases sprinting **Stamina** consumption by 20%, allowing for slightly more dodging ability **** especially with **Stamina** intensive **Charged Attack** Characters.
* Combination of decent **Energy Particle** generation and **Energy Recharge** as an ascension stat allows Kaeya to be able to build heavily into damage and still be able to support his own **Elemental Burst**, especially in **Freeze** team compositions.
* **C2** increases the duration of his **Elemental Burst**.&#x20;
* **C6** adds an additional icicle to the **Elemental Burst** and refunds a portion of the energy cost.

## Works Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Cryo.webp)

* Off-Field DPS capabilities pair well with other **Cryo** Main DPS to add additional **Cryo** application and damage to teams.
* Kaeya's high **Energy Particle** generation allows him to work as a powerful Energy Battery for other **Cryo** Main DPS, especially in **Freeze** teams.
* **Cryo Resonance** as a whole is very powerful in teams which constantly apply the element.

## Does Not Work Well With

* **Geo** Damage shatters **Frozen** enemies making these characters not ideal in **Freeze** teams.
* **Geo** can be used with **Cryo** if you do not intend to **Freeze** enemies.

[**Freeze (Cryo)**](../../teams/freeze.md)****

* Kaeya's energy generation in **Freeze**-based teams is massive, able to support other **Cryo** characters with very little Energy Recharge. He also provides **Cryo Resonance.**
* Kaeya can be used as a Main DPS in Freeze teams, especially in combination with Chongyun. Chongyun's **Cryo Infusion** of **Normal Attacks** allows Kaeya to utilize his high **Normal** and **Charged Attack** damage while still gaining **Elemental Damage** bonuses.
* The combination of the **Blizzard Strayer** set and **Cryo Resonance** can give Kaeya massive amounts of **Critical Rate** with no further investment.

[**Melt (Cryo)**](../../teams/reverse-melt.md)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Rosaria.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xiangling.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Kaeya.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)

* This team is based around frequently applying **Pyro** to enemies and then using Off-Field **Cryo** DPS to cause **Melt** reactions.
* Given frequent enough **Pyro** application, both Kaeya and Rosaria's damage can trigger **Melt.**
* **Melt (Cryo)** teams may lack team flexibility, as they rely on the Elemental applications of multiple characters.

[**Physical (Electro)**](../../teams/physical.md)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Razor.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Kaeya.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Fischl.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Zhongli.png)

* Kaeya's **Elemental Burst** following the active character allows for consistent **Superconduct** applications.
* In teams with Eula, Kaeya can be used to provide both **Cryo Resonance** and act as an Energy Battery.
