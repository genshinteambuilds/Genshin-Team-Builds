# Kaeya

## Roles

* **Off-Field DPS** \(Elemental Burst\)
* **Support:** Energy Battery
* **Main DPS**

## Character Breakdown

* Elemental Skill shoots a cone of Cryo Damage in front of him, healing him based off of his attack and generating a middling amount of energy particles. 
* Elemental Bursts summons 3 icicles that revolve around the character on field for 15 seconds, dealing Cryo Damage to targets they hit.
* His second passive allows his Elemental Skill to generate additional Cryo energy particles \(to a maximum of 2 per use\), whenever enemies are frozen by it.

## Additional Notes

* His passive decreases sprinting stamina consumption by 20%, allowing for slightly more dodging ability especially with Stamina intensive Charged Attack Characters.
* Combination of decent energy generation and Energy Recharge% as an ascension stat allows Kaeya to be able to build fully into damage and still be able to support his own Elemental Burst, especially in Freeze-based team compositions.
* C2 can potentially massively increase the duration of his Elemental Burst and C6 can further increase the cost, further reducing the need for energy.
* The combination of Cryo Resonance, C1, and the Blizzard Strayer artifact set can cause Kaeya's Normal and Charged attacks to have 75% Critical Strike chance against frozen enemies without any additional increases.
* Constellations are more difficult to acquire than other 4 star characters, due to only being available in the Starglitter shop and Standard Banner.

## Works Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/element_cryo.webp) 

* Off-Field DPS capabilities pair well with other Cryo Main DPS to add additional Cryo application to team compositions and enable Cryo resonance.
* Kaeya works as a powerful energy battery for other Cryo Main DPS.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/element_pyro.webp)

* Kaeya's high frequency Cryo application and relatively high damage on his Elemental Burst allows him to function in both Melt and Reverse Melt teams.

* Characters with high Hydro application paired with Kaeya enable easy Freeze.
* Kaeya's energy generation is greatly boosted when he applies Freeze with his Elemental Skill.

* Kaeya's large amount of Area of Affect damage is highly effective when paired with Crowd Control, especially when in comps not utilizing Freeze.
* Similarly to all Elemental Damage focused characters, Kaeya benefits greatly from the Elemental resistance shred provided by Anemo supports and Zhongli.



## Does Not Work Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/element_electro.webp) 

* Barring Physical damage characters, Superconduct falls behind other Elemental Reactions in terms of damage.
* Physical Damage teams can use Kaeya as well as an Electro character to easily trigger Superconduct.

* While Tartaglia can function in Freeze teams, especially with higher constellations, he's typically better used with other elements.

[Freeze ](../../teams/freeze.md)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_kaeya.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_xingqiu.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_chongyun.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_barbara.png) 

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_ayaka.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_xingqiu.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_kaeya.png)  ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_zhongli.png)

* Kaeya's high cryo application as well as extremely high energy generation allows him to easily slot in as an Off-Field DPS in Freeze teams.
* Variants with Chongyun can be used with Kaeya on the field to enhance his Normal and Charged Attacks with Cryo, especially if Kaeya has his C1 to increase his Crit ratio on his Normal and Charged attacks.
* Typically these teams will utilize Kaeya and another Cryo DPS, as Cryo resonance is extremely powerful and easy to upkeep in this team.
* The combination of the Blizzard Strayer artifact set and Cryo Resonance can give Kaeya massive amounts of Critical Strike chance with no further investment. 

[Physical](../../teams/physical.md)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_razor.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_kaeya.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_fischl.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_zhongli.png) 

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_eula.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_kaeya.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_shougun.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_zhongli.png) 

* Kaeya's burst following the active character allows for consistent Superconduct Applications.
* In teams with Eula, Kaeya can be used to provide both Cryo Resonance and increased energy regeneration.

[Melt](../../teams/melt.md)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_hutao.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_kaeya.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_xingqiu.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_jean.png) 

* Kaeya will typically be paired with either an additional Cryo or Hydro Off-Field DPS in this comp, to ensure that every attack from the Pyro Main DPS can be Melted or Vaporized.
* Kaeya's increased Cryo application at C6 can increase the frequency at which this comp can trigger Melt.

[Reverse Melt](../../teams/reverse-melt.md)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_rosaria.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_xiangling.png)  ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_kaeya.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_bennett.png) 

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_klee.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_xiangling.png)  ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_kaeya.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_bennett.png) 

* This team is based around frequently applying Pyro to enemies and then using Off-Field Cryo DPS to cause Melts.
* Given frequent enough Pyro application, both Kaeya and Rosaria's damage can be Melted.
* Reverse Melt teams may lack a flex slot, as they rely on the Elemental applications of multiple characters.
