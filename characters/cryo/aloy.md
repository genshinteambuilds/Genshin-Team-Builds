# Aloy

## Roles

* **Support**: Energy Battery, Buffer (A1)

## Character Breakdown

* **Elemental Skill** throws a Freeze Bomb toward an enemy which deals **Cryo** damage and detonates on impact, spawning multiple mines.
  * Aloy gains a stacking buff called “**Coil**” whenever an enemy is hit by the bomb or mines.
  * **Coil** stacks increase the damage of Aloy’s Normal Attacks.
  * At **A1**, gaining stacks of **Coil** will buff the **ATK** of both Aloy and the party.
* After reaching 4 stacks of **Coil**, Aloy enters the **Rushing Ice** state and gains the following.
  * **Normal Attacks** gain **Cryo infusion.**
  * **Normal Attack** damage is increased.&#x20;
  * **Coil** stacks are reset and cannot be gained.
* **Elemental Burst** deals one large instance of AoE **Cryo** damage.

## Additional Notes

* **Elemental Skill** generates a large number of particles.
  * As such, she can be used as a replacement for Diona in **Freeze** teams that need an **Energy Battery**. However, Aloy is neither a **Healer** nor **Shielder**.
* At **A4**, entering the **Rushing Ice** state will give Aloy a stacking Cryo Damage Bonus buff every second.

## Works Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Ganyu.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Ayaka.png)

* Aloy provides **Cryo Resonance** for additional **Critical Rate** for these **Freeze** team **Main DPS.** For more information about **Freeze** teams, refer to [**Freeze**](../../teams/freeze.md).

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)

* Bennett can be paired with Aloy in a **Melt/Oneshot** team composition where Aloy is used as **Burst DPS** through **Melting** her **Elemental Burst**.

## Does Not Work Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Electro.webp)

* **Electro's Superconduct** reaction with **Cryo** does not improve Aloy's core team compositions.

****![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Geo.webp)****

* **Geo** Damage shatters **Frozen** enemies making these characters not ideal in **Freeze** teams. Even outside of **Freeze** teams, **Geo** characters besides Zhongli tend to lack synergy with Aloy and teams that typically contain her.
