# Aloy

## Roles

* **Support**: Energy Battery, Buffer (A1)

## Character Breakdown

* **Elemental Skill** throws a Freeze Bomb toward an enemy which deals **Cryo DMG** and detonates on impact, spawning multiple Chillwater Bomblets.
  * Aloy gains a stacking buff called "Coil" whenever an enemy is hit by the **Elemental Skill** or Chillwater Bomblets.
  * Coil stacks increase Aloyâ€™s **Normal Attack DMG**.
  * At **A1**, gaining stacks of Coil will buff the **ATK** of both Aloy and team members.
* After reaching 4 stacks of Coil, Aloy enters the Rushing Ice state and:
  * **Normal Attacks** deal **Cryo DMG.**
  * **Normal Attack DMG** is increased.
  * Coil stacks are reset and cannot be gained until Rushing Ice ends.
  * At **A4**, entering the Rushing Ice state will give Aloy a stacking **Cryo DMG** buff every second.
* **Elemental Burst** deals a large amount of **AoE Cryo DMG**.

## Additional Notes

* **Elemental Skill** generates a large number of **Energy Particles**.
  * As such, she can be used as a replacement for Diona in [**Freeze** teams](../../teams/freeze.md) that need an Energy Battery. However, Aloy is neither a Healer nor Shielder.

## Works Well With

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_ganyu.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_ayaka.png)

* Aloy can provide **Cryo Resonance** for additional **CRIT Rate** and **Energy Particles** for Cryo Main DPS characters.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_bennett.png)

* Could potentially be used as a Burst DPS when paired with Bennett in order to Melt her **Elemental Burst**.

## Does Not Work Well With

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_icon\_electro.webp)

* **Electro's Superconduct** reaction with **Cryo** does not improve Aloy's core team compositions.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_icon\_geo.webp)

* **Geo DMG** shatters **Frozen** enemies making these characters not ideal in [**Freeze** ](../../teams/freeze.md)teams.
* **Geo** can be used with **Cryo** if you do not intend to **Freeze** enemies.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Aloy does not particularly shine in any team composition as other characters often provide additional utility. She can still be used in the following teams but is generally not recommended.
