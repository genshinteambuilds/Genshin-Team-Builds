# Diona

## Roles

* **Support**: Healer, Shielder, Energy Battery, Cleanser, Buffer (C6)

## **Character Breakdown**

* **Elemental Skill** changes based on whether it is tapped or held.
  * **Elemental Skill (Tap)** fires two homing projectiles that deal **Cryo DMG** and creates a shield.
  * **Elemental Skill (Hold)** fires five homing projectiles that deal **Cryo DMG** and creates a more powerful shield.
  * **A1** increases movement speed and decreases **Stamina** consumption of characters shielded by Diona's **Elemental Skill.**
  * The shield's damage absorption scales with Diona's **Max HP**.
  * Diona's **Elemental Skill's** shield duration is affected by the number of projectiles that hit enemies.
* **Elemental Burst** creates a field that deals continuous **Cryo DMG** in an **AoE** and continuously heals characters that stand in it.

## **Additional Notes**

* Diona can cleanse using her **Elemental Skill**. Using it will apply **Cryo** for a short duration to the active character upon casting it or switching to another character with the shield up.
* Often paired with another **Cryo** character on **Freeze** teams to act as an Energy Battery and receive Energy in return. This also activates **Cryo Resonance** for additional **CRIT Rate** while enemies are affected by **Cryo** or are **Frozen**.
* **A4** decreases the enemy's ATK by 10% when they are inside the field created by Diona’s **Elemental Burst.**
* **C6** adds 2 conditional buffs to the field created by Diona's **Elemental Burst** which depending on the active character's current **HP**:
  * If their **HP** is below or equal to 50%, **Incoming Healing Bonus** is increased by 30%
  * If their **HP** is above 50%, **Elemental Mastery** is increased by 200.

* Diona works well with almost every team in the game by universally functioning as a **Healer** and a **Shielder**.
* Diona's **C6** **Elemental Mastery** buff helps in teams that focus on **Elemental Reactions**.

## **Does Not Work Well With**

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_bennett.png)

* Bennett already functions as a healer and support, and Diona is often not needed on teams that include Bennett.
* They are still sometimes rarely used together in [**Oneshot**](../../work-in-progress/oneshot.md) team compositions to provide different buffs.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_zhongli.png)

* Zhongli's **Jade Shield** is typically much stronger than Diona's shield and usually removes the need for healing altogether.
* Zhongli’s **Geo Construct** also **Shatters Frozen** enemies.

{% hint style="warning" %}
This character is a healer. While some teams are provided below where they are particularly useful, this character can be used on any team provided you do not have better healing options. Diona's shield is also useful on every team.

[**Freeze (Cryo)**](../../teams/freeze.md)

* Diona activates **Cryo Resonance** for additional **CRIT Rate**. She also provides **Cryo Energy Particles** to charge the **Cryo** Main DPS' **Elemental Burst**.

[**Physical (Cryo)**](../../teams/physical.md)

* Diona acts as an Energy Battery (for **Cryo Physical** Main DPS) and can aid in making **Superconduct** reactions which debuffs the **Physical RES** of enemies.
* Diona's **Stamina** consumption also usually comes in handy on **Physical** teams due to often needing to chase down enemies.
