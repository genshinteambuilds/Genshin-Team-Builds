# Diona

## Roles

* **Support**: Healer, Shielder, Energy Battery, Cleanser, Buffer (C6)

## **Character Breakdown**

* **Elemental Skill** changes based on whether it is tapped or held.
  * **Elemental Skill (Tap)** fires two homing projectiles that deal Cryo damage and create a Shield.
  * **Elemental Skill (Hold)** fires five homing projectiles that deal Cryo damage and creates a more powerful Shield.
  * At **A1**, characters shielded by this **Elemental Skill** gain increased movement speed and decreased stamina consumption.
  * The **Shield Absorption** scales with Diona's **Maximum HP**.
  * Diona's **Elemental Skill's** Shield duration is affected by the number of projectiles that hit enemies.
* **Elemental Skill** will apply **Cryo** for a short duration to the active character upon cast or switch (while shielded) and can cleanse **Pyro** and **Electro** auras.
* **Elemental Burst** creates a field that deals continuous **Cryo** damage in an AoE and continuously heals characters that stand in it.

## **Additional Notes**

* Often paired with another **Cryo** character on Freeze teams to act as an Energy Battery and receive Energy in return, also activates **Cryo** Resonance for additional **Critical Rate** while enemies are affected by **Cryo** or is **Frozen**.
* At **A4,** enemy Attack is reduced by 10% when they are inside the field created by Diona’s **Elemental Burst.**
*   Her **C6** has 2 conditional buffs when a party member is inside her Elemental Burst depending on their current HP:

    If the party members' **HP** is below or is equal to 50%, their incoming healing bonus is increased by 30%. If their **HP** is above 50%, their **Elemental Mastery** is increased by 200.&#x20;

## **Works Well With**

****![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Ayaka.png)****![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Ganyu.png)****

* Diona provides **Cryo Resonance** for additional **Critical Rate** for these Freeze team Main Dps, for more information about **Freeze** teams, refer to [**Freeze**](../../teams/freeze.md).

* Diona reduces the **stamina consumption** and can also aid making **Superconduct** reactions, also helps **Cryo Physical** Main DPS in recharging their **Elemental Burst** with her energy generation. For more information about **Physical** teams, refer to [**Physical**](../../teams/physical.md).

* Diona works well with almost every team in the game by universally functioning as a **Healer** and a **Shielder**.
* Diona's **C6** **Elemental Mastery Buff** helps in teams that focus on **reaction damage**.

## **Does Not Work Well With**

****![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)****

* Bennett already functions as a **healer** and **support**, and Diona is often not needed on teams that includes Bennett.
  * Generally not problematic as later **Abyss** floors require two teams.
* However, they can be used together in [**Oneshot**](../../teams/oneshot.md) team compositions

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Zhongli.png)

* Zhongli's **Jade Shield** often outperforms Diona's **Shield** and reduces the need for **healing**.
  * If two **Shields** are active at the same time, both will take damage simultaneously.
* Zhongli’s **Geo construct** also **shatters frozen** enemies.
