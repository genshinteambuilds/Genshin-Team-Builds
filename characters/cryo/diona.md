# Diona

## Roles

* **Support**: Healer, Shielder, Energy Battery, Cleanser, Buffer (C6)

## **Character Breakdown**

* Elemental Skill changes based on whether it is tapped or held.
  * On tap, she fires two homing projectiles that deal Cryo damage, then gains a Shield.
  * On hold, she fires 5 such projectiles and gains a more powerful Shield.
  * At A1, characters shielded by this Elemental Skill gain increased movement speed and decreased stamina consumption.
  * The Shield's Absorption scales with Diona's Maximum HP.
* Elemental Skill will apply Cryo for a short duration to the active character upon cast or switch (while shielded) and can cleanse Pyro and Electro auras.
* Elemental Burst creates a field that deals continuous Cryo damage in an AoE and continuously heals characters that stand in it.
  * C6 Buffs the Elemental Mastery of characters with more than 50% HP that are standing within the field.

## **Additional Notes**

* Often paired with another Cryo character on Freeze teams to act as an Energy Battery and receive Energy in return, also activates Cryo Resonance for additional Crit Rate while enemies are affected by Cryo or is Frozen.
* Her Elemental Skill's Shield duration is affected by the number of projectiles that hit enemies.
* At A4, enemy Attack is reduced by 10% when they are inside the field created by Diona’s Elemental Burst.
*   Her C6 has 2 conditional buffs when a party member is inside her Elemental Burst depending on their current HP:

    If the party members' HP is below or is equal to 50%, their incoming healing bonus is increased by 30%. If their HP is above 50%, their Elemental Mastery is increased by 200.&#x20;

* Diona reduces the stamina consumption and can also aid making Superconduct reactions, also helps Cryo Physical Main DPS in funneling their burst with her energy generation. For more information about Physical teams, refer to [**Physical**](../../teams/physical.md).

* Diona works well with almost every team in the game by universally functioning as a Healer and a Shielder.
* Diona's C6 Elemental Mastery Buff helps in teams that focus on reaction damage.

## **Does Not Work Well With**

****![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)****

* Bennett already functions as a healer and support, and Diona is often not needed on teams that includes Bennett.
  * Generally not problematic as later Abyss floors require two teams.
* However, they can be used together in [**One-shot**](../../teams/oneshot.md) team compositions

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Zhongli.png)

* Zhongli's Jade Shield often outperforms Diona's Shield and reduces the need for healing.
  * If two Shields are active at the same time, both will take damage simultaneously.
* Zhongli’s Geo pillar also shatters frozen enemies.

* Diona activates Cryo resonance for additional Crit Rate. She also provides Cryo energy particles for main carries' burst to be back off cooldown as well as protection with her shield**.**

* Diona acts as an Energy Battery (for Cryo Physical main dps) and can aid in making superconduct reactions that reduces Physical RES of enemies affected by the reaction. Also reduces stamina consumption for chasing down enemies especially for melee Physical Main DPS.

****[**Melt**](../../teams/melt.md)****

* Diona reduces stamina consumption, making Hu Tao do more charged attacks especially at if she's at C0. Diona also provides shielding to protect Hu Tao, as well as provide emergency healing for when the team's HP is too low.
