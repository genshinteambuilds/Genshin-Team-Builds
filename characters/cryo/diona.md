# Diona

## Roles

* **Support** \(Healer, Shielder, Energy Battery, Cleanser, Buffer, Debuffer\)

## **Character Breakdown**

* Elemental Skill changes based on whether it is tapped or held. 
  * On tap, she fires two homing projectiles that deal Cryo damage, then gains a Shield.
  * On hold, she fires 5 such projectiles and gains a more powerful Shield.
  * At A1, characters shielded by this Elemental Skill gain increased movement speed and decreased stamina consumption.
  * The Shield's Absorption scales with Diona's Maximum HP.
* Elemental Skill will apply Cryo for a short duration to the active character upon cast or switch \(while shielded\) and can cleanse Pyro and Electro auras.
* Elemental Burst creates a field that deals continuous Cryo damage in an AoE and continuously heals characters that stand in it.
  * Constellation 6 Buffs the Elemental Mastery of characters with more than 50% HP that are standing within the field.

## **Additional Notes**

* Often paired with another Cryo character in Freeze teams to act as an Energy Battery and receive Energy in return.
* Her Elemental Skill's Shield duration is affected by the number of projectiles that hit enemies.
* At A4, enemy Attack is reduced by 10% when they are inside the field created by Diona’s Elemental Burst.

## **Works Well With**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_ganyu.png) 

* Diona serves as an Energy Battery and Cyro resonance enabler for freeze Ganyu. For a more detailed Freeze team comp, check out Freeze \[hyperlink\]

* Diona reduces Razor's Stamina Consumption and can also aid with Superconduct. For more information about Physical teams, refer to physical \[hyperlink\]

* Diona works well with almost all teams in the game by universally functioning as a Healer and Shielder.
* Diona's Constellation 6 Elemental Mastery Buff aids in teams that focus on reaction damage.

## **Does Not Work Well With**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_bennett.png) 

* Bennett already functions as a Healer and Support, and Diona is often unneeded on teams that include Bennett.
  * Generally not problematic as later Abyss floors require two teams.
* However, they can be used together in One-shot team compositions

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_zhongli.png) 

* Zhongli's Shield often outperforms Diona's Shield and reduces the need for healing.  
  * If two Shields are active at the same time, both will take damage simultaneously.
* Zhongli’s Geo pillar can shatter frozen enemies.
