# Ayaka

## Roles

* **Main DPS**
* **Burst DPS**
* **Off-Field DPS** (through Elemental Burst, mostly for [Oneshot](../../teams/oneshot.md) **Melt** setups)
* **Support**: Debuffer (C4)

## Character Breakdown

* **Dashing** infuses her **Normal** and **Charged Attacks** with **Cryo** and applies **Cryo** to surrounding enemies when Ayaka reappears after finishing her dash.
  * **A4** allows Ayaka to regain **Stamina** and receive a buff to her **Cryo** Damage if an enemy is hit by this effect.
* **Elemental Skill** deals **AoE Cryo** damage.
* **Elemental Burst** creates a snowstorm that deals a huge amount of **Cryo** damage over 5 seconds and slowly moves away from the character.
  * The snowstorm will stop moving upon encountering large or **Frozen** enemies, resulting in that enemy potentially taking up to 20 hits from this ability.
* Ayaka's primary source of damage is her **Elemental Burst.**

## **Additional Notes**

* **Charged Attack** has an increased range over Ayaka's **Normal Attacks**.
* **C2** summons 2 additional smaller snowstorms that deal 20% of the original snowstorm's damage.
* **C4** reduces the **Defense** of enemies hit by her **Elemental Burst** by 30% for 6s.
* Ayaka can technically be used in **Melt** teams as both a Burst DPS role whilst providing Off-Field **Cryo** application to the enemy for 5 seconds with her **Elemental Burst**.
  * This is typically only done with very powerful teams and [Oneshot ](../../teams/oneshot.md)setups since her Off-Field capabilities outside of those 5 seconds is nonexistent.

## Works Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Mona.png)

* Often paired with either of these characters in order to create a **** [**Freeze** team](../../teams/freeze.md).
* **Freeze** teams using Mona also often use **Anemo** characters that can infuse their Off-Field abilities with **Hydro** to help apply **Hydro** more often.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Diona.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Cryo.webp)

* Diona is usually the healer of choice in Ayaka [**Freeze** teams](../../teams/freeze.md) as she provides **Cryo** **Resonance**, acts as an Energy Battery, and can also provide shielding for the team.
* When not using Diona as a healer, an additional **Cryo** character is normally used with Ayaka to provide **Cryo** **Resonance** in **** [**Freeze** teams](../../teams/freeze.md).

* **Anemo** support characters work well with Ayaka by reducing the enemy's **Elemental Resistance** with **Viridescent Venerer**. **Anemo** characters often also supply useful **Crowd Control** abilities or other buffs.
* Kazuha, Sucrose and Venti can additionally infuse their **Elemental Bursts** with **Hydro** or **Cryo**, helping provide those elements in a [**Freeze** team](../../teams/freeze.md).

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)

* Primarily only used for Ayaka [Oneshot ](broken-reference/)setups as **Pyro** can interfere with [**Freeze** team](../../teams/freeze.md) compositions.



![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Hutao.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Klee.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xiangling.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Yanfei.png)

* These characters can be paired with Ayaka in a [Oneshot ](ayaka.md#oneshot)**Melt** team composition where Ayaka is used as Burst DPS and very short duration Off-Field DPS during her **Elemental Burst**.
* **Melt** teams using Ayaka are almost always [Oneshot ](../../teams/oneshot.md)team setups since Ayaka's **Elemental Burst** lasts only 5 seconds and can only be reasonably applied to large enemies in this composition.&#x20;
* **Melt** teams using Ayaka can struggle at putting out sustained DPS after Ayaka's **Elemental Burst** is entirely finished and on cooldown.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Shougun.png)

* Despite being an **Electro** character, Raiden's **Elemental Skill** will not interrupt the **Frozen Elemental Reaction**. Additionally, Ayaka can also reduce her **Energy Recharge** requirements as Raiden will generate energy for Ayaka with her **Elemental Burst**.

## Does not work well with

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Electro.webp)

* Electro's **Superconduct** reaction with **Cryo** does not improve Ayaka's core team compositions.
* There are superior **Cryo** supports to Ayaka to provide **Superconduct** for **Physical** teams.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Geo.webp)

* **Geo** Damage shatters **Frozen** enemies making these characters not ideal in **Freeze** teams.&#x20;
* **Geo** can be used with **Cryo** if you do not intend to **Freeze** enemies.

#### [Freeze (Cryo)](../../teams/freeze.md)

* Ayaka works as the Main DPS in **Freeze** teams and is the primary source of **Cryo** application.
* **Cryo Resonance** is often included in **Freeze** teams to boost Ayaka's **Critical Rate**.

#### [Oneshot (Standard)](../../teams/oneshot.md)

* A team constructed purely to amplify Ayaka's **Elemental Burst** damage for the purposes of killing bosses or other enemies incredibly fast.

#### [Oneshot (Melt)](ayaka.md#oneshot)

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Hutao.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Ayaka.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Kazuha.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)

* A **Melt** team that swaps to Yanfei after Ayaka uses her **Elemental Burst** in order to perform **Charged Attacks** on Yanfei that **Melt** for large amounts of damage.
* Ayaka's **Elemental Burst** still does a very large amount of damage on this team.
