# Chongyun

## Roles

* **Burst DPS**
* **Support**: Buffer (C2)

## Character Breakdown

* **Elemental Skill** deals **AoE** **Cryo** **DMG** and creates a field on the ground within which all **Sword**, **Claymore** and **Polearm**-wielding characters' weapons will be infused with **Cryo**.
  * This can potentially allow any character using these weapon types to act as a Main DPS in a **Freeze** team.
  * **A4** causes a second instance of **AoE Cryo** **DMG** when the field expires and reduces the **Cryo RES** of enemies hit by this.
* **Elemental Burst** summons 3 spirit blades that deal large **AoE** **Cryo** **DMG** and knock enemies back.

## **Additional Notes**

* Chongyun's main utility comes from his **Elemental Skill**, which enables other characters to **Freeze** or **Melt** their **Normal** and **Charged Attacks**.
* **C2** reduces the cooldowns of **Elemental Skills** and **Elemental Bursts** cast within the field generated by Chongyun's **Elemental Skill** by 15%.
* **C6** both increases the **DMG** of Chongyun's **Elemental Burst** and causes it to summon another spirit blade, increasing the number of blades from 3 to 4.

## Works Well With

* Often paired with either of these characters in order to create a [**Freeze** ](../../teams/freeze.md)team.

* As with all Elemental DPS, **Anemo** supports and Zhongli work well by reducing the enemy's **Elemental RES** with **Viridescent Venerer** or Zhongli's Jade Shield. **Anemo** characters often also supply useful **Crowd Control** abilities or other buffs.
* Kazuha, Sucrose and Venti can also additionally infuse their **Elemental Bursts** with **Hydro**, **Cryo**, or **Pyro** helping provide those elements in a **Freeze** or **Melt** team.

* These characters can be paired with Chongyun in a **Melt** team composition where Chongyun is used as Burst DPS with his **Elemental Burst**.

## Does Not Work Well With

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Electro.webp)

* Electro's **Superconduct** reaction with **Cryo** does not improve Chongyun's core team compositions.
* Chongyun should not be used if **Superconduct** is needed for a **Physical** team, as Chongyun's **Elemental Skill** is anti-synergistic with **Physical** Main DPS characters due to its **Cryo** infusion.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Geo.webp)

* **Geo** **DMG** shatters **Frozen** enemies making these characters not ideal in **Freeze** teams.
* **Geo** can be used with **Cryo** if you do not intend to **Freeze** enemies.

* In **Freeze** teams, Chongyun acts as a Burst DPS and Support and can help provide **Cryo Resonance**.
* The **Cryo Infusion** from Chongyun's **Elemental Skill** can help non-standard Main DPS characters deal **Cryo** **DMG** with their **Normal Attacks** and **Charged Attacks**.
* Chongyun can also act as an Energy Battery for other **Cryo** characters on the team.

* A variation of the popular "National Team" where Chongyun acts as a Burst DPS and Support.
* This variation allows for both **Melt** and Reverse **Melt** reactions, and Chongyun's **C2** slightly speeds up the team's rotations.
