# Chongyun

## Roles

* **Burst DPS**
* **Support**: Buffer (C2)

## Character Breakdown

* Elemental Skill deals AoE Cryo damage and creates a field on the ground.
  * Claymore, Sword, and Polearm wielding characters gain both a Cryo infusion on their Normal and Charged Attacks as well as increased Attack Speed while within the field.
  * A4 causes a second instance of AoE Cryo damage when the field expires.
* Elemental Burst summons 3 spirit blades that deal large AoE Cryo damage and knock enemies back.

## **Additional Notes**

* Chongyun's main utility comes from his Elemental Skill, which enables other characters to Freeze or Melt their Normal and Charged Attacks.
* A4 reduces enemies Cryo resistance with its burst of damage.&#x20;
* C2 reduces the cooldowns of Elemental Skills and Elemental Bursts cast within the field generated by Chongyun's Elemental Skill by 15%.
* C6 both increases the damage of Chongyun's Elemental Burst and causes it to create another spirit blade, functionally increasing the damage by 33%.&#x20;

## Works Well With

* Often paired with either of these characters in order to create a Freeze team.

* As with all Elemental Damage DPS, Anemo supports and Zhongli work well by reducing the enemy's Elemental Resistance with Viridescent Venerer or Zhongli's Jade Shield. Anemo characters often also supply useful Crowd Control abilities or other buffs.
* Kazuha, Sucrose and Venti can also additionally infuse their Elemental Bursts with Hydro, Cryo, or Pyro helping provide those elements in a Freeze or Melt team.

* These characters can be paired with Chongyun in a Melt team composition where Chongyun is used as Burst DPS through frequently Melting his Elemental Burst.

## Does Not Work Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Electro.webp)

* Electro's Superconduct reaction with Cryo does not improve Chongyun's core team compositions.
* Chongyun should not be used if Superconduct is needed for a Physical team, as Chongyun's Elemental Skill is anti-synergistic with Physical DPS due to its Cryo infusion.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Geo.webp)

* Geo characters besides Zhongli see little benefit from pairing with Chongyun due to the lack of damaging reactions between Geo and Cryo.

#### [Freeze](../../teams/freeze.md)

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Rosaria.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Mona.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Chongyun.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Kazuha.png)

* In Freeze teams, Chongyun acts as a Burst DPS and Support. The Cryo Infusion from Chongyun's Elemental Skill helps keep enemies frozen, and the extra Crit Rate gained from Cryo Resonance and the Blizzard Strayer artifact set let Chongyun utilize a more offensive build.
* Chongyun can also act as an Energy Battery to other Cryo characters on the team.

#### [Reverse Melt](../../teams/reverse-melt.md)

#### &#x20;![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Klee.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Chongyun.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Kazuha.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)

* In these teams, Chongyun acts as a Burst DPS. His Elemental Burst should be melted by prior Pyro application from Bennett or Klee.

[**National**](../../teams/national.md)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xiangling.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Chongyun.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)

* A variation of the popular "National Team" where Chongyun acts as a Burst DPS and Support.
* This variation allows for both Melt and Reverse Melt reactions, and Chongyun's C2 slightly speeds up the team's rotations.&#x20;
