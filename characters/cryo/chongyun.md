# Chongyun

## Roles

* **Sub DPS** \(Burst\)

## Character Breakdown

* Chongyun's Elemental Skill involves a strike on the ground which deals AoE Cryo damage and creates a Chonghua Frost field
  * Claymore, Sword, and Polearm wielding characters gain a Cryo infusion on their Normal Attacks while in this field, as well as increased Attack Speed
  * At A4, a spirit blade is released at the end of the duration of the Frost field, and deals AoE Cryo damage
* Elemental Burst summons 3 spirit blades that deal large AoE Cryo damage and knocks enemies back

## **Additional Notes**

* Chongyun's main utility comes from his Frost field, which enables Freeze or Melt with other characters
* With Constellation 2, Chongun's Frost field will reduce the cooldowns of all Skills and Bursts casted within it by 15% 
* The majority of Chongyun's damage comes from his Elemental Burst, which is improved by Constellation 6
* Can act as a Noblesse Oblige set holder for a team as he has both low cooldown and energy cost on his Elemental Burst

## Works Well With

* Often paired with either of these characters in order to create a [Freeze team](../../teams/freeze.md).

* As with all Elemental Damage DPS, Anemo supports and Zhongli work well by reducing the enemy's Elemental Resistance with Viridescent Venerer or Zhongli's Jade Shield. Anemo characters often also supply useful Crowd Control abilities or other buffs.
* Kazuha, Sucrose and Venti can also additionally infuse their Elemental Bursts with Hydro, Cryo, or Pyro helping provide those elements in a [Freeze](../../teams/freeze.md) or [Melt](../../teams/reverse-melt.md) team

* These characters can be paired with Chongyun in a Melt team composition where Chongyun is used as Burst DPS as he has a fairly short Skill and Burst duration

## Does Not Work Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/element_electro.webp) 

* Electro's Superconduct reaction with Cryo does not improve Chongyun's core team compositions.
* Chongyun's Frost field is anti-synergistic with Physical DPS, and there are better Cryo characters that can proc Superconduct reactions

![](../../.gitbook/assets/element_geo.webp) 

* Since Cryo does not react well with Geo, there are few characters besides Zhongli that can either help or be helped by Chongyun's position on the team

#### [Freeze](../../teams/freeze.md)

* Chongyun works as a sub DPS and supplies Cryo infusion to his teammates on their Normal Attacks, and with the Blizzard Strayer 4 set bonus as well as Cryo resonance, he can gain up to 55% Critical Rate, allowing for a more offensive build.

#### [Reverse Melt](../../teams/reverse-melt.md)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_chongyun.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_klee.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_kazuha.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_bennett.png) 

* A team that swaps to Chongyun after Pyro application from either Bennett or Klee to enable large Reverse Melt damage

[**National Team**]()\*\*\*\*

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_chongyun.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_xiangling.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_xingqiu.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_bennett.png) 

* A variation of the popular "National Team" where Chongyun acts as a Sub DPS as well as a Freeze/Melt enabler.
* This variation is very well rounded, and Chongyun still does a large amount of damage with Reverse Melt and Bennett.
