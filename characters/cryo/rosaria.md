# Rosaria

## Roles

* **Off-Field DPS** \(Elemental Burst\)
* **Main DPS**
* **Support:** Debuffer \(C6\)

## Character Breakdown

* Casting Rosaria's Elemental Skill will reposition herself behind her target and deal 2 instances of Cryo damage. Note that this repositioning only works against smaller enemies.
* Her Elemental Burst starts with a wide swing with her weapon that deals Cryo damage then deals continuous AoE Cryo damage in a circle around the ice lance summoned in front of her.

## Additional Notes

* Her 1st ascension talent increases her crit rate by 12% for 5 seconds when she uses her elemental skill.
* Her 4th ascension talent will increase the whole party's critrRate \(except Rosaria\) based on Rosaria's Crit Rate and will cap at 15% \(Rosaria with 100% Crit Rate\) and is stackable with other crit rate buffs \(Food, Hu Tao, etc.\).
* Her passive talent increases the whole party's movement speed during the night \(18:00 - 6:00\) by 10%. 
* Rosaria's C2 increases the duration of her elemental burst by 4 seconds, making her burst last for 2 more instances of AoE Cryo damage.

##   Works Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/element_cryo.webp) 

* Having Rosaria with another Cryo character will activate Cryo Resonance and is beneficial for Freeze teams. On top of the crit rate from the Cryo resonance, she herself gives a certain amount of crit rate for the whole party. 
* She can also act as a battery for Cryo Main DPS like Eula or Ayaka.

* She provides Cryo damage to that can be used to apply the Superconduct reaction which reduces physical resistance of enemies hit by the reaction.

* She can either enable Pyro damage dealers to Melt with their damage, or she can use the Pyro application from them to apply reverse Melt to do more damage herself.

* Fischl and Beidou provides Electro damage to apply Superconduct that reduces the physical res of enemies hit. These characters are notable for supporting a physical damage dealer that cannot apply Electro to enemies themselves.

* As with all Elemental Damage dealers, Anemo supports and Zhongli work well due to their Elemental Resistance debuff from Viridescent Venerer's set effect or Zhongli's Jade Shield. Anemo characters often also supply useful Crowd Control abilities or other buffs.

## Does Not Work Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/element_geo.webp) 

* Geo Damage shatters Frozen enemies making these characters not ideal in Freeze team compositions.
* Even outside of Freeze team compositions, Geo characters besides Zhongli are still generally not used due to poor synergy of the character's themselves with Rosaria and not being as competitive as other options on the team.

**Main DPS**

[Freeze](../../teams/freeze.md)

* Rosaria's Elemental skill and burst provides ample amounts of Cryo application that provides permanent freezing of enemies. With the aid of Chongyun's Elemental Skill that infuses Rosaria's Normal Attacks, causing her attacks to deal Cryo damage. This makes freezing enemies even more consistant. 

[Physical](../../teams/physical.md)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_rosaria.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_fischl.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_beidou.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_diona.png) 

* This team provides consistent physical damage from Rosaria's Normal Attacks and is further increased by using Superconduct that decreases enemies physical resistance. 

[Reverse Melt](../../teams/reverse-melt.md)

* With the consistent Pyro application from Xiangling and Bennett, Rosaria's elemental skill and burst can be consistantly melted for additional damage via the reactions.
* With Chongyun, Rosaria's Normal and Charged attacks can be made to do Cryo damage. This allows these attacks to Melt as well for aditional damage, as well as benefit from the Cryo damage bonus from Rosaria's artifacts for this team..
