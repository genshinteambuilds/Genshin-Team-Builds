##   Works Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/element_cryo.webp) 

* Having Rosaria with another cryo will activate Cryo Resonance and is beneficial for Freeze teams. On top of the crit rate from the cryo resonance, she herself gives a certain amount of crit rate for the whole party. 
* She can also act as a battery for Cryo Main DPS like Eula or Ayaka.

* She can act as the cryo source for these pyro main dps to melt or she's the one melting their on field pyro application.

* Fischl and Beidou provides electro damage to proc superconduct that reduces physical res of enemies hit.

* As with all Elemental Damage DPS, Anemo supports and Zhongli works well by reducing the enemy's Elemental Resistance with Viridescent Venerer or Zhongli's Jade Shield. Anemo characters often also supply useful Crowd Control abilities or other buffs.
* Many can also create persistent fields that can absorb elements to help enable Melt or Frozen Elemental Reactions to take place.

## Does Not Work Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/element_geo.webp) 

* Geo Damage shatters Frozen enemies making these characters not ideal in Freeze team compositions.
* Even outside of Freeze team compositions, Geo characters besides Zhongli are still generally not used due to poor synergy of the character's themselves with Rosaria and not being as competitive as other options on the team.

* This team provides consistent physical damage from Rosaria's Normal Attacks and is further increased by using superconduct that decreases enemies physical resistance.
