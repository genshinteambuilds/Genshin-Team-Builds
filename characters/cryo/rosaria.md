# Rosaria

## Roles

* **Off-Field DPS** \(Elemental Burst\)
* **Main DPS**
* **Support:** Debuffer \(C6\)

## Character Breakdown

* Elemental Skill will reposition herself behind her target and deal 2 instances of Cryo damage. Against large enemies you will be moved to their front instead.
* Elemental Burst starts with a wide swing with her weapon that deals Cryo damage then triggers continuous blasts of Cryo damage in a circle around the ice lance summoned in front of her.

## Additional Notes

* Her Ascension 1 Talent increases her Crit rate by 12% for 5 seconds when she uses her Elemental Skill.
* Her Ascension 4 Talent will increase the whole party's Crit Rate \(except Rosaria\) by 15% of Rosaria's Crit Rate after activating her Elemental Burst
* C1 provides Rosaria with an attack speed and damage increase on her Normal Attacks after triggering a Critical Hit, providing her a near constant buff for her Normal Attacks.
* C2 increases the duration of her Elemental Burst by 4 seconds, making her Elemental Burst trigger 2 more blasts of Cryo damage. 
* C4 greatly improves Rosaria's self energy regeneration, allowing her to maintain her Elemental Burst easier.
* C6 causes her Elemental Burst to reduce enemy Physical Resistance by 20% for 10 seconds, allowing her to act as a Debuffer for Physical teams. 

##   Works Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/element_cryo.webp) 

* Cryo Resonance is extremely powerful, both for Rosaria and other Cryo characters, and is worth activating; especially in Freeze teams, where the combination of Cryo Resonance and the Blizzard Strayer artifact set can give 55% Crit Rate with no further investment.
* Rosaria's high energy generation can be very valuable for other Cryo Main DPS, such as Ayaka or Eula.

* Rosaria provides both consistent energy generation and Off-Field cryo application for Physical DPS to trigger Superconduct.

* Rosaria can either provide Cryo application for Pyro characters to Melt their attacks, or she can use the Pyro application from them to Reverse Melt her own attacks.

* Fischl and Beidou provide Off-Field Electro damage which when combined with Rosaria's Cryo application can trigger Superconduct for Physical DPS characters, especially those who lack a way to trigger Superconduct on their own.

* As with all Elemental Damage dealers, Anemo supports and Zhongli work well due to their Elemental Resistance debuff from Viridescent Venerer's set effect or Zhongli's Jade Shield. Anemo characters often also supply Crowd Control abilities to increase 

## Does Not Work Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/element_geo.webp) 

* Geo Damage shatters Frozen enemies making these characters not ideal in Freeze team compositions.
* Even outside of Freeze team compositions, Geo characters besides Zhongli tend to lack synergy with Rosaria and teams that typically contain her.

* Rosaria's Elemental Skill and Burst provides ample amounts of Cryo application that provides permanent freezing of enemies. 
* Chongyun's Elemental Skill can convert Rosaria's Normal and Charged Attacks into Cryo damage, allowing her to act as a Main DPS while using the aspects of her kit tailored around her Normal and Charged Attacks.
* The combination of Cryo Resonance, the Blizzard Strayer artifact set, and Rosaria's Ascension 4 Talent can give massive amounts of Crit Rate to other Cryo Main DPS.

* Rosaria can either be used as a Main DPS or an Off-Field DPS and Debuffer in Physical teams.
* As a Physical Main DPS, Rosaria can use her easy Cryo application to trigger Superconduct and her C1 and C6 to further enhance her damage.
* As a Off-Field Sub DPS in Physical teams, Rosaria can provide Physical resistance reduction with her C6 as well as both Cryo application for Superconduct and access to Cryo Resonance.

* With the consistent Pyro application from Xiangling and Bennett, Rosaria's elemental skill and burst can be consistently melted for additional damage via the reactions.
* With Chongyun, Rosaria's Normal and Charged attacks can be made to do Cryo damage. This allows these attacks to Melt as well for additional damage, as well as allowing Rosaria to build her artifacts fully for Cryo damage and still utilize her entire kit.
