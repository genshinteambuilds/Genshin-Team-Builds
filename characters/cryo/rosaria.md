# Rosaria

## Roles

* **Off-Field DPS** (Elemental Burst)
* **Main DPS**
* **Support**: Buffer (A4), Debuffer (C6)

## Character Breakdown

* **Elemental Skill** moves Rosaria behind her target and deal 2 instances of **Cryo** damage. Against large enemies, Rosaria simply moves within range of them and not behind them.
* **Elemental Burst** starts with a wide swing with her weapon that deals **Cryo** damage then triggers continuous blasts of **Cryo** damage in a circle around the Ice Lance summoned in front of her.
* **A1** increases her **CRIT Rate** by 12% for 5 seconds when she uses her **Elemental Skill**.
* **A4** increases the whole party's **CRIT Rate** (except Rosaria) by 15% after using her **Elemental Burst**.

## Additional Notes

* **C1** provides Rosaria with an **Attack Speed** and damage buff on her **Normal** **Attacks** after triggering a **Critical Hit**.
* **C2** increases the duration of her **Elemental Burst** by 4 seconds, making her **Elemental Burst** trigger 2 more blasts of **Cryo** damage.
* **C4** greatly improves Rosaria's self energy regeneration, allowing her to use her **Elemental Burst** more easily.
* **C6** causes her **Elemental Burst** to reduce enemy **Physical Resistance** by 20% for 10 seconds, allowing her to act as a debuffer **** for **Physical** teams.

## Works Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Cryo.webp)

* **Cryo Resonance** is extremely powerful and especially in [**Freeze** ](../../teams/freeze.md)teams where the combination of **Cryo** Resonance and the **Blizzard Strayer** artifact set can give up to 55% **CRIT Rate**.
* Rosaria can act as an Energy Battery for other **Cryo** Main DPS, such as Ayaka or Eula.

* Rosaria provides both consistent energy generation **** and Off-Field **Cryo** application for **Physical** DPS to trigger **Superconduct**.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Pyro.webp)

* Rosaria can either provide **Cryo** application for Pyro characters to **Melt** their attacks, or she can use the **Pyro** application from them to **Melt** her own attacks.

## Does Not Work Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Geo.webp)

* **Geo** Damage shatters **Frozen** enemies making these characters not ideal in [**Freeze** ](../../teams/freeze.md)teams.
* **Geo** can be used with **Cryo** if you do not intend to **Freeze** enemies.

## Teams

{% endhint %}

[**Melt (Cryo)**](../../teams/reverse-melt.md)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Rosaria.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xiangling.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Sucrose.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)

* With consistent **Pyro** application from Xiangling and Bennett, Rosaria's **Elemental Skill** and **Burst** can consistently **Melt** for increased damage.
* After activating Xiangling and Rosaria's **Elemental Bursts** in Bennett's field, Rosaria generally does not stay on-field, but rather, the team's skills are cycled through.
* Sucrose's skills are used to maintain an **Elemental Mastery** buff and provide Viridescent Venerer debuffing and Bennett's **Elemental Skill** is used as often as possible to provide energy for Xiangling.

****[**Freeze (Cryo)**](../../teams/freeze.md)****

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Ayaka.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Mona.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Rosaria.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Sayu.png)

* Rosaria's **Elemental Skill** and **Elemental Burst** provide ample amounts of **Cryo** application that together with **Hydro** can inflict the **Frozen** status on enemies.
* The combination of **Cryo Resonance**, the **Blizzard Strayer** set, and Rosaria's **A1** can give **Cryo** Main DPS characters large amounts of **CRIT Rate**.
* Rosaria can act as an Energy Battery for other **Cryo** Main DPS characters.

[**Physical (Cryo)**](../../teams/physical.md)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Eula.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Fischl.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Rosaria.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Zhongli.png)

* Rosaria's **Physical Resistance** reduction at **C6** makes her a powerful option for a [**Physical** ](../../teams/physical-cryo.md)team, given how few sources exist to enhance the damage type.
* Even without **C6**, Rosaria can still provide energy for a **Cryo** character like Eula, Off-Field **Cryo** application to trigger **Superconduct**, and a teamwide buff to **CRIT Rate** after casting her **Elemental Burst**.

### Character Specific Teams

**Freeze (w/ Chongyun)**

* Rosaria plays the role of the On-field Main DPS in this team dealing damage with **Normal** and **Charged** **Attacks** infused with **Cryo** thanks to Chongyun's **Elemental Skill.**
* **Kokomi** provides **Hydro** application with her Elemental Skill allowing this team to **Freeze** enemies. Kokomi also provides healing.
* Kazuha provides the **Viridescent Venerer** debuff and Crowd Control Grouping.

{% hint style="info" %}
Possible substitutions:

* Kokomi can be substitued for Xingqiu, Mona or any other source of Off-field **Hydro** application. Note that the team will lose it's source of healing if Kokomi is replaced and another replacement healer may be desired.
* Kazuha can be replaced with any other **Anemo** support character.

* Rosaria can be used as a **Physical** Main DPS if you do not have other options.

* Her **C1** and **C6** further supplements her **Physical** damage.

****![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Klee.png)****![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Rosaria.png)****![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Kazuha.png)****![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)****

* An alternative **Melt** team that allows Rosaria's **Elemental Burst** to **Melt** while Klee or Yanfei applies **Pyro** to the enemies with their **Normal Attacks**, **Charged Attacks** and abilities.
