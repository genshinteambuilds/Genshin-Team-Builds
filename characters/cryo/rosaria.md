# Rosaria

## Roles

* **Off-Field DPS** (Elemental Burst)
* **Main DPS**
* **Support**: Buffer (A4), Debuffer (C6)

## Character Breakdown

* **Elemental Skill **moves Rosaria behind her target and deal 2 instances of **Cryo **damage. Against large enemies, Rosaria simply moves within range of them and not behind them.
* **Elemental Burst **starts with a wide swing with her weapon that deals **Cryo **damage then triggers continuous blasts of **Cryo **damage in a circle around the **Ice Lance **summoned in front of her.
* **A1 **increases her **Critical Rate **by 12% for 5 seconds when she uses her Elemental Skill.
* **A4 **increases the whole party's **Critical Rate **(except Rosaria) by 15% after using her **Elemental Burst**.

## Additional Notes

* **C1 **provides Rosaria with an **Attack Speed **and damage increase on her **Normal** **Attacks **after triggering a **Critical Hit**, providing her a near constant buff** **for her **Normal Attacks**.
* **C2 **increases the duration of her **Elemental Burst **by 4 seconds, making her **Elemental Burst **trigger 2 more blasts of **Cryo **damage.
* **C4 **greatly improves Rosaria's self energy regeneration, allowing her to maintain her **Elemental Burst **easier.
* **C6 **causes her **Elemental Burst** to reduce enemy **Physical Resistance **by 20% for 10 seconds, allowing her to act as a debuffer** **for **Physical** teams.

## Works Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Cryo.webp)

* **Cryo Resonance **is extremely powerful, both for Rosaria and other **Cryo **characters, and is worth activating; especially in **Freeze **teams, where the combination of **Cryo **Resonance and the **Blizzard Strayer** artifact set can give 55% **Critical Rate **with no further investment.
* Rosaria's high energy generation** **can be very valuable for other **Cryo **Main DPS, such as Ayaka or Eula.

* Rosaria provides both consistent energy generation** **and Off-Field** Cryo **application for **Physical **DPS to trigger **Superconduct**.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Pyro.webp)

* Rosaria can either provide **Cryo **application for Pyro characters to **Melt **their attacks, or she can use the **Pyro **application from them to **Melt **her own attacks.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Fischl.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Beidou.png)

* Fischl and Beidou provide **Off-Field Electro **damage which when combined with Rosaria's **Cryo **application can trigger **Superconduct **for **Physical **Main DPS characters, especially those who lack a way to trigger **Superconduct **on their own.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Anemo.webp)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Zhongli.png)

* As with all Elemental Damage DPS, **Anemo** supports and Zhongli work well by reducing the enemies' **Elemental Resistance** with **Viridescent Venerer** or Zhongli's **Jade Shield**. **Anemo** characters often also supply useful Crowd Control abilities or other buffs and utility.

## Does Not Work Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Geo.webp)

* **Geo **Damage shatters **Frozen **enemies making these characters not ideal in **Freeze **teams.
* Even outside of **Freeze **teams, **Geo **characters besides Zhongli tend to lack synergy with Rosaria and teams that typically contain her.

### Main DPS

[**Freeze**](../../teams/freeze.md)****

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Rosaria.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Chongyun.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Kazuha.png)

* Rosaria's **Elemental Skill **and **Burst **provides ample amounts of **Cryo **application that provides permanent **freezing **of enemies.
* Chongyun's **Elemental Skill **can convert Rosaria's **Normal **and **Charged Attacks **into **Cryo **damage, allowing her to act as a Main DPS while using the aspects of her kit tailored around her **Normal **and **Charged Attacks**.
* The combination of **Cryo **Resonance, the **Blizzard Strayer **set, and Rosaria's **A1 **can give herself massive amounts of **Critical Rate**.

[**Melt (Cryo)**](../../teams/reverse-melt.md)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Rosaria.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xiangling.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Sucrose.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)

* With the consistent **Pyro **application from Xiangling and Bennett, Rosaria's **Elemental Skill **and **Burst **can consistently **Melt **for increased damage via the **reactions**.

[**Physical**](../../teams/physical.md)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Rosaria.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Fischl.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Beidou.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Diona.png)

* As a **Physical **Main DPS, Rosaria can use her easy **Cryo **application to trigger **Superconduct **and her **Constellation 1** and **Constellation 6 **to further enhance her damage.

### Sub DPS/Support

****[**Freeze**](../../teams/freeze.md)****

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Ayaka.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Mona.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Rosaria.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Venti.png)

* Rosaria's **Elemental Skill **and Burst provides ample amounts of **Cryo **application that provides permanent **freezing **of enemies.
* The combination of **Cryo **Resonance, the **Blizzard Strayer **set, and Rosaria's **A1 **can give herself massive amounts of **Critical Rate **other **Cryo **Main DPS.
* Rosaria's relatively high **energy generation **can help provide **energy **for **Cryo **Main DPS.

[**Melt (Pyro)**](../../teams/melt.md)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Hutao.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Rosaria.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Diona.png)

* Rosaria provides constant **Cryo **application to enemies, which can be used for **Pyro **Main DPS to **Melt**.

[**Physical**](../../teams/physical.md)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Eula.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Fischl.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Rosaria.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Zhongli.png)

* Rosaria's **Physical resistance **reduction at **C6 **makes her a powerful option for a **Physical **team, given how few sources exist to enhance the damage type.
* Even without **Constellation 6**, Rosaria can still provide energy for a **Cryo **character like Eula, **Off-Field Cryo **application to trigger **Superconduct**, and a teamwide buff to **Critical Rate **after casting **Elemental Burst**.
