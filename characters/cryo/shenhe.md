# Shenhe

## Roles

* **Support**: Buffer (Elemental Skill, A1, A4), Debuffer (Elemental Burst), Energy Battery

## Character Breakdown

* **Elemental Skill** provides different effects if it is either held down or tapped.&#x20;
  * **Elemental Skill (Tap)** causes Shenhe to dash forward, dealing **Cryo Damage** to enemies hit and grants the party the Icy Quill buff.
  * **Elemental Skill (Hold)** deals **AoE Cryo Damage** and grants the party the Icy Quill buff.
  * Icy Quill increases **Cryo Damage** dealt by other party members by a percentage of Shenhe's **ATK**. This buff lasts either until the duration expires or it is triggered a certain amount of times.
  * **Elemental Skill (Hold)** provides Icy Quill with a longer duration and more potential triggers.&#x20;
  * **A4** provides an additional damage bonus to either **Elemental Skill** and **Elemental Burst** damage with **Elemental Skill (Tap)** or **Normal, Charged,** and **Plunging Attack** damage with **Elemental Skill (Hold)**.
* **Elemental Burst** deals AoE **Cryo Damage** and creates a field.
  * Shenheâ€™s **Elemental Burst** will continue to periodically deal **Cryo Damage** to enemies in this field, and enemies within this field will have their **Physical** and **Cryo Resistances** debuffed.&#x20;
  * **A1** buffs the **Cryo Damage** of party members within this field.

## Additional Notes

* **C1** gives Shenhe an additional charge of her **Elemental Skill**.
* **C2** increases the duration of her **Elemental Burst** and buffs the **Crit DMG** of any **Cryo Damage** dealt by party members within its field.
* **C4** increases the damage of Shenhe's **Elemental Burst** based on how many **Icy Quill** stacks have been used.
* **C6** lets **Normal** and **Charged Attacks** not use up **Icy Quill** stacks.

* **Cryo** DPS in particular will benefit greatly from Shenhe's **Icy Quill** buffs.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)

* Depending on the team composition, Bennett's ability to buff **ATK** synergizes well with Shenhe's **Icy Quill,** as it is based on **ATK**.&#x20;
* Note that Bennett should not be utilized in **Freeze** teams as his abilities may cause **Melt** reactions and interfere with keeping enemies **Frozen**.

* Shenhe is incapable of providing any buffs to **Electro** or **Geo** characters. The buffs and debuffs she can provide to **Physical** team compositions are also not very strong.&#x20;
* Most **Anemo**, **Pyro**, and **Hydro** characters do not directly synergize with Shenhe but instead provide their utility to the Cryo DPS in their respective teams.
