# Shenhe

## Roles

* **Off-Field DPS** (Elemental Skill)
* **Support:** Buffer

## Character Breakdown

* **Elemental Skill** provides different effects if it is either held down or tapped.&#x20;
  * **Elemental Skill (Tap)** dashes Shenhe forward, dealing **Cryo Damage** to enemies hit and grants the party the Icy Quill buff.
  * **Elemental Skill (Hold)** deals **AoE** **Cryo Damage** and grants the party the Icy Quill buff.
  * Icy Quill increases **Cryo Damage** dealt by other party members by a percentage of Shenhe's Attack. This buff lasts either until the duration expires or being triggered a certain amount of times
  * **Elemental Skill (Hold)** provides Icy Quill with a longer duration and more potential triggers.
  * **A4** provides an additional 15% damage bonus to either **Elemental Skill** and **Burst Damage** with **Elemental Skill (Tap)** or **Normal, Charged,** and **Plunging Attack Damage** with **Elemental Skill (Hold)**
* **Elemental Burst** deals **AoE Cryo Damage** and then creates a field which periodically deals additional **AoE Cryo Damage** and reduces the **Cryo** and **Physical Resistance** of enemies inside.
  * **A2** provides a 15% **Cryo Damage** buff to any party members inside the field created by Shenhe's **Elemental Burst**.

## Additional Notes

* **C2** provides a 15% **Cryo Critical Damage** buff to any party members inside the field created by Shenhe's **Elemental Burst**.
* **C6** prevents **Normal** and **Charged Attacks** from counting towards the Icy Quill trigger limit.
* Shenhe's Icy Quill can only be triggered by **Cryo Damage**, making her far less useful in any team that does not have other **Cryo** DPS characters to make use of her buff. ****&#x20;
