# Shenhe

## Roles

* **Support**: Buffer (Elemental Skill, A1, A4), Debuffer (Elemental Burst), Energy Battery

## Character Breakdown

* **Elemental Skill** provides different effects if it is either held down or tapped.
  * **Elemental Skill (Tap)** causes Shenhe to dash forward, dealing **Cryo DMG** to enemies hit and grants the party 5 stacks of the Icy Quill buff.
  * **Elemental Skill (Hold)** deals **AoE Cryo DMG** and grants the party 7 stacks of the Icy Quill buff.
  * Icy Quill increases **Cryo DMG** dealt by other party members by a percentage of Shenhe's **ATK**. This buff lasts either until the duration expires or it is triggered a certain amount of times. Each party member has their own set of stacks.
  * **A4** provides an additional **DMG Bonus** to either **Elemental Skill** and **Elemental Burst** **DMG** with **Elemental Skill (Tap)** or **Normal, Charged,** and **Plunging Attack** **DMG** with **Elemental Skill (Hold)**.
* **Elemental Burst** deals **AoE Cryo DMG** and creates a field.
  * Shenheâ€™s **Elemental Burst** will continue to periodically deal **Cryo DMG** to enemies in this field, and enemies within this field will have their **Physical** and **Cryo RES** debuffed.
  * **A1** buffs the **Cryo DMG** of party members within this field.

## Additional Notes

* **C1** gives Shenhe an additional charge of her **Elemental Skill**.
* **C2** increases the duration of her **Elemental Burst** and buffs the **CRIT DMG** of any **Cryo DMG** dealt by party members within its field.
* **C4** increases the **DMG** of Shenhe's **Elemental Burst** based on how many Icy Quill stacks have been used.
* **C6** lets **Normal** and **Charged Attacks** not use up Icy Quill stacks.

## Works Well With

* **Cryo** DPS can use Shenhe's Icy Quill buff to increase their **Cryo DMG**.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_bennett.png)

* Depending on the team composition, Bennett's ability to buff **ATK** synergizes well with Shenhe's Icy Quill, as it is based on Shenhe's **ATK**.
* Note that Bennett should not be utilized in **Freeze** teams as his abilities may cause **Melt** reactions and interfere with keeping enemies **Frozen**.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_eula.png)

* Shenhe debuffs enemies' **Phys RES** for Eula.
* Shenhe acts as an Energy Battery for the Energy-hungry Eula.

## Does Not Work Well With

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_icon\_electro.webp)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_icon\_geo.webp)

* Shenhe is incapable of providing any buffs to **Electro** or **Geo** characters. The debuff she can provide to **Physical** team compositions is also not very strong.
* Most **Anemo**, **Pyro**, and **Hydro** characters do not directly synergize with Shenhe but instead provide utility to the On-Field DPS in many teams Shenhe is in.

{% hint style="info" %}
In all of the teams below, Shenhe universally provides a buff to the **Cryo DMG** of all characters and acts as an Energy Battery for the **Cryo** Main DPS.

[**Freeze**](../../teams/freeze.md)

* Shenhe provides buffing with her **Elemental Skill** and buffing and debuffing with her **Elemental Burst** for a **Cryo** On-Field DPS.
* Shenhe should use her **Elemental Skill (Tap)** in this team to provide an **Elemental Burst DMG** increase for Ayaka.

[**Melt (Cryo)**](../../teams/reverse-melt.md)

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_rosaria.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_xiangling.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_shenhe.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_bennett.png)

* Shenhe provides buffing for Rosaria with her **Elemental Skill** and buffing and debuffing with her **Elemental Burst.**
* Shenhe also functions as an Off-Field DPS in this team, using her **Elemental Burst** to apply **Cryo** and frequently trigger **Melt** reactions.

****[**Physical (Cryo)**](../../teams/physical-cryo.md)****

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_eula.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_shenhe.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_rosaria.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_zhongli.png)

* Although this team centers around Eula dealing **Physical DMG**, it does not have **Superconduct**.
* Both Shenhe and Rosaria(C6) provide **Physical RES** debuff.
* With two off-field **Cryo** applicators, Shenhe and Rosaria, 100% **Cryo** uptime is achievable, allowing Eula to always be under the influence of **Cryo Resonance**, increasing her **CRIT Rate**.
* Zhongli provides a shield for survivability and **Physical RES** debuff.
