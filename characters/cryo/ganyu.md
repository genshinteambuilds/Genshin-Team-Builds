# Ganyu

## **Roles**

* **Main DPS**
* **Off-Field DPS** (Elemental Burst)
* **Support**: Crowd Control (Taunting), Buffer (C4)

## **Character Breakdown**

* Ganyu's **Charged Attack **has two **Charge levels**:
  * **Charge Level 1**: Fires a single arrow that deals **Cryo **Damage
  * Charge Level 2: Fires a **Frostflake **arrow that deals **Cryo **Damage. The **Frostflake Arrow blooms **after hitting it's target, dealing additional **AoE Cryo **damage.
* **Elemental Skill **deals **AoE Cryo **Damage and leaves a **Ice Lotus **on the ground that **Taunts **surrounding enemies. The Ice Lotus deals **AoE Cryo **Damage if destroyed or when it's duration ends.
* **Elemental Burst **creates a field which continually **rains shards of ice **on enemies inflicting **Cryo **damage.
* Ganyu's primary source of damage when used as a Main DPS character is her **Charged Attack**.

## **Additional Notes**

* Ganyu’s **Frostflake Arrow Bloom **from her fully **Charged Attack **has a separate **internal cooldown **for reactions from the initial attack which allows Ganyu to trigger **reactions **with both components of her **Charged Attack**. This is incredibly powerful with Ganyu's **Reverse Melt **team compositions as both attacks can **Melt**.
* Ganyu's **Elemental Burst **is typically not used much in **Reverse Melt **team compositions as the application of **Cryo **to enemies from her **Burst **can interfere with the **Reverse Melt **reactions coming from her **Charged Attacks**.
* When used in a **Off-Field DPS** or **Support **capability, Ganyu's **Elemental Burst **can apply **Cryo **to enemies but this is not fast enough to enable **Melt **team compositions by herself.
* While Ganyu can be used to apply **Cryo **for **Freeze **teams or **Physical **teams in an **Off-Field DPS **and **Support **role as well, Ganyu deals so much damage as a **Main DPS** character that this often performs worse than simply just using Ganyu in the **Main DPS** character role.

## Works Well With

* **Anemo **Support characters can **Debuff Cryo Resistance **of enemies with the **Viridescent Venerer **set.
* Many can also create persistent fields that can **absorb elements **to help enable **Melt **or **Frozen Elemental Reactions **to take place.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Mona.png)

* Mona is currently the premier **Support **for **Freeze **Ganyu team compositions.
* When using Mona's **Elemental Burst**, **Omen **and **Hydro **are applied to the enemy, **amplifying damage **and also **freezing **them.
* **Omen's **duration is also **extended **while enemies are **frozen **allowing Ganyu to continue attacking enemies affected by **Omen **for longer.

* A second **Cryo **character is often used in **Freeze **team compositions to provide **Cryo Resonance**. **Cryo Resonance **increases the team's **Critical Rate **against enemies that are affected by **Cryo **or **Frozen **by 15%.
* Not all **Cryo **characters are appropriate choices. Typically, **Cryo **characters that fulfill other roles are chosen.
* One of the most popular options is **Diona **as she can additionally provide **Healing**, **Shielding**/**Cleansing**, and carry the **Noblesse Oblige **set.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Zhongli.png)

* He provides a universal **Debuff **to enemy **Resistance **for all **elements **while also providing the strongest **Shielding **in the game.

* The two primary **Pyro **character options for a **Reverse Melt **team composition using Ganyu.
* Xiangling's **Elemental Burst **in particular can apply **Pyro **to enemies consistently, allowing Ganyu to **Reverse Melt **every **Charged Attack **however this requires sticking quite close to the enemy to stay within range of her **Elemental Burst**.

## Does Not Work Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Electro.webp)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Eula.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Razor.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xinyan.png)

* Ganyu’s primary source of damage is not **Physical **resulting in other **Physical **characters and **Electro **characters not working well with her when Ganyu is used as a Main DPS.
* While Ganyu can be used as an **Off-Field **DPS in those teams instead to provide **Cryo **for **Superconduct**, this is often seen as a waste since other **Cryo **characters can work equally well in that role.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Ningguang.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Albedo.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Aether\_Geo.png)

* **Geo **Damage **shatters Frozen **enemies making these characters not ideal in **Freeze **team compositions.
* Even outside of **Freeze **team compositions, **Geo **characters besides Zhongli are still generally not used due to poor synergy of the character's themselves with Ganyu and not being as competitive as other options on the team.

#### [Freeze](../../teams/freeze.md)

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Ganyu.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Mona.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Venti.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Diona.png)

* This particular example is often called Morgana due to the combination of Mona and Ganyu.
* Ganyu makes use of Mona's **Elemental Burst **to **Freeze **enemies while **amplifying damage **done to them with **Omen**. Omen's duration is extended while enemies are **Frozen **allowing Ganyu to continue dealing **amplified damage **for a longer period of time.
* Other Freeze team compositions without Mona can still work. All Ganyu Freeze teams primarily work by providing extended Immobilization **Crowd Control **through the **Frozen **Elemental Reaction.

#### [Reverse Melt](../../teams/reverse-melt.md)

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Ganyu.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xiangling.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Zhongli.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)

* Ganyu uses Xiangling’s **Elemental Burst **to apply **Pyro **to enemies and **Reverse Melt **them with Ganyu’s **Charged Attacks**.
* Bennett's **Elemental Burst **can also be used although only for a single **Charged Attack**.
