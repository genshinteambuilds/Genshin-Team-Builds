# Ganyu

## **Roles**

* **Main DPS**
* **Off-Field DPS** (Elemental Burst)
* **Support**: Crowd Control (Taunting), Buffer (C4)

## **Character Breakdown**

* Ganyu's **Charged Attack** has two Charge levels:
  * Charge Level 1: Fires a single arrow that deals **Cryo DMG**
  * Charge Level 2: Fires a Frostflake Arrow that deals **Cryo DMG**. The Frostflake Arrow blooms after hitting it's target, dealing additional **AoE Cryo DMG**.
* **Elemental Skill** deals **AoE Cryo DMG** and leaves an Ice Lotus on the ground that taunts surrounding enemies. The Ice Lotus deals **AoE Cryo DMG** if destroyed or when it's duration ends.
* **Elemental Burst** creates a field which continually rains shards of ice on enemies inflicting **Cryo DMG**.
* Ganyu's primary source of damage when used as a Main DPS character is her **Charged Attack**.

## **Additional Notes**

* Ganyu’s Frostflake Arrow Bloom from her fully **Charged Attack** has a separate internal cooldown for reactions from the initial attack which allows Ganyu to trigger reactions with both components of her **Charged Attack**. This is incredibly powerful with Ganyu's **Melt** teams as both parts of the attack can **Melt**.
* Ganyu's **Elemental Burst** is typically not used much in **Melt** teams as the application of **Cryo** on enemies from her **Elemental Burst** can interfere with the **Melt** reactions coming from her **Charged Attacks**.
* When used as an Off-Field DPS or Support, Ganyu's **Elemental Burst** can apply **Cryo** to enemies but this is not fast enough to enable **Melt** teams by herself.
* While Ganyu can be used to apply **Cryo** for **Freeze** teams or **Physical** teams in an Off-Field DPS and Support role as well, Ganyu deals so much damage with her **Charged Attacks** that this often performs worse than simply just using Ganyu as the Main DPS character.

## Works Well With

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_kazuha.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_venti.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_sucrose.png)

* **Anemo** Support characters can debuff the **Cryo RES** of enemies with the **Viridescent Venerer** set.
* Many can also create persistent fields that can absorb elements to help enable **Melt** or **Frozen Elemental Reactions** to take place.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_mona.png)

* Mona is currently the premier Support for **Freeze** Ganyu teams.
* When using Mona's **Elemental Burst**, **Omen** and **Hydro** are applied to the enemy, amplifying **DMG** and also inflicting the **Frozen** status on them.
* Omen's duration is also extended while enemies are **Frozen** allowing Ganyu to continue attacking enemies affected by Omen for longer.

* A second **Cryo** character is often used in **Freeze** teams to provide **Cryo Resonance,** which increases the team's **CRIT Rate** against enemies that are affected by **Cryo** or **Frozen**.
* Not all **Cryo** characters are appropriate choices. Typically, **Cryo** characters that fulfill other roles are chosen.
* One of the most popular options is **Diona** as she can additionally provide healing, shielding, cleansing, and carry the **Noblesse Oblige** set.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_zhongli.png)

* Zhongli provides a universal debuff to **Elemental RES** for all elements while also providing the strongest shielding in the game.
* Shielding is particularly useful for Ganyu as her **Charged Attacks** take time to charge fully and can be interrupted if not shielded.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_bennett.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_xiangling.png)

* The two primary **Pyro** character options for a **Melt** teams using Ganyu.
* Xiangling's **Elemental Burst** in particular can apply **Pyro** to enemies consistently, allowing Ganyu to **Melt** every **Charged Attack** however this requires sticking quite close to the enemy to stay within range of her **Elemental Burst**.

## Does Not Work Well With

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/element\_electro.webp)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_eula.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_razor.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_xinyan.png)

* Ganyu’s primary source of damage is not **Physical** resulting in other **Physical** characters and **Electro** characters not working well with her when Ganyu is used as a Main DPS.
* While Ganyu can be used as an Off-Field DPS in those teams instead to provide **Cryo** for **Superconduct**, this is often seen as a waste since other **Cryo** characters can work equally well in that role.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/element\_geo.webp)

* **Geo** **DMG** shatters **Frozen** enemies making these characters not ideal in [**Freeze** ](../../teams/freeze.md)teams.
* Zhongli is also not used in Ganyu **Freeze** teams for this reason.
* **Geo** can be used with **Cryo** if you do not intend to **Freeze** enemies.

## Teams

#### [Freeze (Cryo)](../../teams/freeze.md)

* This particular example is often called Morgana due to the combination of Mona and Ganyu.
* Ganyu makes use of Mona's **Elemental Burst** to **Freeze** enemies while amplifying **DMG** done to them with Omen. Omen's duration is extended while enemies are **Frozen** allowing Ganyu to continue dealing amplified **DMG** for a longer period of time.

#### [Melt (Cryo)](../../teams/reverse-melt.md)

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_ganyu.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_xiangling.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_zhongli.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_bennett.png)

* Ganyu uses Xiangling’s **Elemental Burst** to apply **Pyro** to enemies to create **Melt** reactions with Ganyu’s **Charged Attacks**.
* Bennett's **Elemental Burst** can also be used apply **Pyro** although only a single **Charged Attack** can be **Melted** off of it.
