# Ganyu

## **Roles**

* **Main DPS**

## **Character Breakdown**

* The Majority of Ganyu’s damage in a Melt comp comes from her Charged Shot, her burst is often neglected since it can potentially mess up Pyro auras and making her Melt Charged Shot’s harder to execute.
* Ganyu in a Freeze comp has her damage evenly split across Burst and Charged Shots, whether one has more contribution depends on your rotation options.
* Generally Melt Ganyu is preferred for higher DPS at lower constellations, while Freeze Ganyu offers Freeze as CC utility and shines more as her constellations grow.
* Combos or Rotations may differ depending on play style options.

## **Additional Note**

* Ganyu’s Bloom shot hits Crit separately, even if your first shot hits a crit the bloom shot might not Crit.
* Ganyu’s Bloom shot has a separate ICD from the Charge shot, meaning you can trigger Melt reaction twice in one shot \(as long as there is a lingering Pyro aura\).
* Ganyu’s Skill can taunt enemies and draw enemy aggro away from you.
* Ganyu’s Burst costs 60 energy, although not very high, she’s not great at generating energy herself so when you run Freeze comp \(where her Burst uptime is prioritized\), make sure you get some ER for her if you don’t have Venti.
* For burst sub dps Ganyu: For any teams that may want constant Cryo off-field applications, Ganyu may be a viable option, but one of the problems is that Ganyu’s Burst damage is usually split across many enemies and she can’t really make great use out of Reverse Melt damage, she’s mostly there to cover for teams that may want consistent and AoE Cryo applications.

## Works Well With

* An Anemo character is almost always needed for freeze team comps, especially Ganyu’s. They infuse their Anemo off field damage into cryo while using 4 set Viridescent Venerer that shreds off enemy cryo resistance.

* Mona is the perfect Hydro support for Freeze Ganyu team comp. When she uses her burst, she applies omen debuff into the enemy, freezing it extends its duration, thus extending the damage timer of omen and essentially extending overall freeze time. \(for more information about omen, click [here](../hydro/mona.md)\)

* A second cryo character is always needed for freeze team comps as their resonance increases crit rate if enemies are affected by cryo or frozen.
* One of Ganyu’s core options for healer is Diona, she functions as a shielder, battery, potential Noblesse Oblige \(4\) holder and potential cleanser. Generally she’s Freeze Ganyu’s most desired healer option.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_zhongli.png) 

* Zhongli is great for Ganyu as he can provide a lot of survivability with his Jade Shield. The shield also decreases cryo resistance of enemies by 20%.
* Zhongli for Melt Ganyu to cover for her vulnerability during aim mode, also provides additional Elemental/Physical Resistance reduction to enemies nearby the shield.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_bennett.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_xiangling.png) 

* Her most optimal options for Melt Ganyu. Xiangling capable of maintaining Pyro auras on enemies for constant Melt Charge Shots. Her only downside is the requirement for a certain range so she remains effective, while not being able to efficiently charge her own burst up.

## Does Not Work Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/element_electro.webp) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/element_geo.webp) 

* For Freeze team comps, you generally don't want a geo character in the party since geo damage and attacks shatters frozen enemies, making Ganyu's lose the additional 20% Crit Rate from Blizzard Strayer \(4\)
* For electro, Ganyu’s main source of damage is not Physical, so having an Electro support or sub dps for superconduct is not needed.

[Freeze](../../teams/freeze.md)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_ganyu.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_mona.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_venti.png)OR ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_kazuha.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_diona.png) 

* A common freeze team composition that focuses on Ganyu dealing high amounts of aimed cryo chraged attacks to frozen enemies with the aid of Mona's Omen, which is often called as Morgana team comp.
* Ganyu makes use of Mona's Elemental Burst to freeze enemies while debuffing enemies with Omen. Omen debuff increases damage taken by enemies for a short period of time, Ganyu's Aimed charged shots increases the time duration of Omen, thus making her Aimed charged shots deals more damage.
* The only difference between Venti and Kazuha in a Freeze Ganyu team comp is if there are many small mobs, Venti is situationally better and his A4 also helps Ganyu for her Burst uptime, but for single target or small group of mobs, Kazuha can outshine Venti as he also increases Ganyu's Cryo DMG bonus.

[Reverse Melt](../../teams/reverse-melt.md)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_ganyu.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_xiangling.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_bennett.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_kazuha.png) or ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_zhongli.png) 

* Ganyu uses Xiangling’s Elemental Burst to apply pyro aura to enemies and melt it with Ganyu’s Aimed Charged Attacks. Kazuha with Viridescent Venerer \(4\) can swirl cryo and pyro together to decrease their respective resistances and aid Xiangling with applying pyro aura.
* With Zhongli, you gain more survivability with his Jade Shield and his burst's CC creates more time to do your rotations.
