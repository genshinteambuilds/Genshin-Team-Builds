# Ganyu

## **Roles**

* **Main DPS**
* **Sub DPS** \(Off-Field\)
* **Support:** Crowd Control \(Taunting\)

## **Character Breakdown**

* Elemental Burst deals AoE Cryo Damage and leaves a Cryo Lotus on the ground that Taunts surrounding enemies. The Lotus deals AoE Cryo Damage if destroyed or when it's duration ends.
* Elemental Skill creates a field which continually rains shards of ice on enemies inflicting Cryo damage.
* Ganyu's primary source of damage when used as a Main DPS character is her fully charged Aimed Charged Attack.

## **Additional Notes**

* Ganyu’s Frostflake Arrow Bloom from her fully charged Aimed Charged Attack has a separate ICD from the initial attack which allows Ganyu to trigger reactions with both components of her Aimed Charged Attack. This is incredibly powerful with Ganyu's Reverse Melt team compositions as both attacks can Melt.
* Ganyu's Elemental Burst is typically not used much in Reverse Melt team compositions as the application of Cryo to enemies from her Burst can interfere with the Reverse Melt reactions coming from her Aimed Charged Attacks.
* When used in a Off-Field DPS or Support capability, Ganyu's Elemental Burst can apply Cryo to enemies but this is not fast enough to enable Melt team compositions by herself.
* While Ganyu can be used to apply Cryo for Freeze teams or Physical teams in an Off-Field DPS and Support role as well, Ganyu deals so much damage as a Main DPS character that this often performs worse than simply just using Ganyu in the Main DPS character role.

## Works Well With

* Anemo Support characters can Debuff Cryo Resistance of enemies with Viridescent Venerer.
* Many can also create persistent fields that can absorb elements to help enable Melt or Frozen Elemental Reactions to take place.

* Mona is currently the premier Support for Freeze Ganyu team compositions. 
* When using Mona's Elemental Burst, Omen and Hydro are applied to the enemy, amplifying damage and also freezing them. 
* Omen's duration is also extended while enemies are frozen allowing Ganyu to continue attacking enemies affected by Omen for longer.

* A second Cryo character is often used in Freeze team compositions to provide Cryo Resonance. Cryo Resonance increases the team's Critical Rate against enemies that are affected by Cryo or Frozen by 15%.
* Not all Cryo characters are appropriate choices. Typically, Cryo characters that fulfill other roles are chosen.
* One of the most popular options is Diona as she can additionally provide Healing, Shielding, carry the Noblesse Oblige 4-set to provide Buffing and additionally provide potential Cleansing for the team.

* Zhongli works with virtually every character in Genshin Impact. He provides universal Debuffing for all elements as well as Physical team compositions while also providing the strongest Shielding in the game.

* The two primary Pyro character options for a Reverse Melt team composition using Ganyu.
* Xiangling's Elemental Burst in particular can apply Pyro to enemies consistently, allowing Ganyu to Reverse Melt every Aimed Charged Shot however this requires sticking quite close to the enemy to stay within range of her Elemental Burst.

## Does Not Work Well With

* Ganyu’s primary source of damage is not Physical resulting in other Physical characters and Electro characters not working well with her when Ganyu is used as a Main DPS.
* While Ganyu can be used as an Off-Field DPS in those teams instead to provide Cryo for Superconduct, this is often seen as a waste since other Cryo characters can work equally well in that role.

* Geo Damage shatters Frozen enemies making these characters not ideal in Freeze team compositions.
* Even outside of Freeze team compositions, Geo characters besides Zhongli are still generally not used due to poor synergy of the character's themselves with Ganyu and not being as competitive as other options on the team.

#### [Freeze](../../teams/freeze.md)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_ganyu.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_mona.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_venti.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_diona.png) 

* This particular example is often called Morgana due to the combination of Mona and Ganyu.
* Ganyu makes use of Mona's Elemental Burst to Freeze enemies while amplifying damage done to them with Omen. Omen's duration is extended while enemies are Frozen allowing Ganyu to continue dealing amplified damage for a longer period of time.
* Other Freeze team compositions without Mona can still work. All Ganyu Freeze teams primarily work by providing extended Immobilization Crowd Control through the Frozen Elemental Reaction.

#### [Reverse Melt](../../teams/reverse-melt.md)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_ganyu.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_xiangling.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_bennett.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_zhongli.png) 

* Ganyu uses Xiangling’s Elemental Burst to apply Pyro to enemies and Reverse Melt them with Ganyu’s Aimed Charged Attacks.
* Bennett's Elemental Burst can also be used although only for a single Aimed Charged Attack.
