# Eula

## **Roles**

* **Main DPS** \(Cryo/Physical\)
* **Burst DPS**

## **Character Breakdown**

* Eula primarily uses her Elemental Burst along with Normal Attacks for the bulk of her damage
* Elemental skill \(tap\) has a short base cooldown and builds stacks of Grimheart which increase Eula’s defense and resistance to interruption \(Maximum of 2 stacks\)
* Holding Eula’s Elemental skill consumes all Grimheart stacks to unleash a strong multihit attack with a high Physical hit at the end of it \(if you had at 2 Grimheart stacks\) and applies a Physical and Cryo resistance debuff, making it necessary for optimal DPS and is especially important to apply before her burst damage
* Elemental Burst also grants a stack of Grimheart and resets the cooldown of her Elemental skill, making it very easy to get max Grimheart in a quick burst combo
* Elemental Burst deals a colossal amount of Physical Damage at the end of its effect based on how many times Eula hit enemies with Normal Attacks and Elemental Skills while her Lightfall Sword is present \(right after her initial burst cast\). Should always aim to get your damage and debuffs out immediately after casting her burst.

## **Additional Notes**

* Icetide Vortex’s \(Eula’s Elemental Skill\) hold variant can hit a total of 4 times, one from the initial cast, two from Icewhirl Brands granted from accumulating Grimheart stacks, and finally one from the Shattered Lightfall sword created by her first Ascension talent, making it especially strong at stacking her Elemental Burst
* Eula’s Burst does NOT snapshot buffs which makes short-lasting buffs much less useful for her burst rotation

## **Works Well With**

* Lisa works exceptionally well with a Eula that’s focused on extreme burst damage, she can apply superconduct to weaken enemy Physical Resistance, apply a strong Defense debuff with her second Ascension talent and can buff Eula’s attack significantly with the Thrilling Tales of Dragonslayer’s Catalyst as well as with the Noblesse Oblige set

* Fischl can fulfill the same role as Lisa but trades off some of the raw burst damage for consistency and uptime. Fischl can use the Tenacity of Millelith Artifact set in a team with Eula to grant her a constant Atk buff



* Electro Traveler specifically can be a great Superconduct support for Eula if additional Energy generation is required for Eula’s Elemental Burst thanks to the high amount of Energy he/she can create for the team

* Zhongli can prevent Eula from being interrupted which is especially important during her Burst combos for stacking her Lightfall Sword and provides a good chunk of extra damage thanks to his Resistance Shred

## **Does Not Work Well With**

* Mona’s Omen debuff from her Elemental Burst does not last long enough for Eula to finish stacking her Lightfall Sword for the full duration

* Eula should always want to focus on Physical damage due to her Elemental Burst, Chongyun’s Cryo infusion will reduce the damage she deals from her Normal Attacks by a significant amount

* Anemo characters in general cannot be used to buff Eula’s damage through common methods such as Sucrose, Kazuha and the Viridescent Venerer set due to her dealing largely Physical Damage, it’s still possible to use Anemo’s for their crowd control and utility but for the most part should be avoided

* Compared to a oneshot team, this team focuses more on giving Eula higher sustained DPS and Burst uptime with the addition of Diona as a Cryo battery

* A very basic and straightforward Burst Eula team, focused on buffing Eula as much as possible as well as debuffing enemies for a powerful Lightfall Sword oneshot
