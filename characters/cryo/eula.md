# Eula

## **Roles**

* **Main DPS**
* **Burst DPS**

## **Character Breakdown**

* Eula relies on her Elemental Burst and Normal Attacks to deal Physical damage. 
* Elemental Skill changes based on whether it is tapped or held.
* * On tap, she deals Cryo damage and gains a stack of Grimheart.
    * Grimheart increases Eula's defense and resistance to interruption. A maximum of two stacks can be held.
  * On hold, she consumes all Grimheart stacks, deals Cryo damage, and activates the following effects:
    * Each stack of Grimheart consumed creates an instance of AoE Cryo damage.
    * If any Grimheart stacks are consumed, surrounding enemies will have their Physical and Cryo Resistance debuffed.
    * At A4, if two stacks of Grimheart are consumed this way, Eula will create a miniature version of her Elemental Burst which explodes instantly, dealing Physical damage.
* Elemental Burst grants a stack of Grimheart and resets the cooldown of her Elemental Skill.
  * As such, Eula should generally always use her Elemental Skill \(tap\) before using her Elemental Burst. 
* Elemental Burst deals huge AOE Physical Damage after a set duration, or if Eula is switched out.
  * Elemental Burst damage will increase based on how many times Eula hits enemies during its duration.

## **Additional Notes**

* In order to maximize damage, Eula should first tap her Elemental Skill before using her Elemental Burst. She should then take advantage of the cooldown reset and hold her Elemental Skill. 
  * This will consume the 2 stacks of Grimheart generated beforehand to both debuff Enemy Resistances and deal 4 instances of damage, which count toward her Elemental Burst.
* Eula’s Burst does NOT snapshot buffs.
  * This makes short-lasting buffs much less useful for her Elemental Burst damage.

## **Works Well With**

\*\*\*\*![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_lisa.png) ****

* Lisa works well to support a Eula focused on extreme burst damage. She can apply Superconduct, debuff enemy defense, hold the Thrilling Tales of Dragonslayer’s Catalyst, and use the Noblesse Oblige set.

* Fischl can fulfill the same role as Lisa but trades off Eula's Elemental Burst damage for Superconduct uptime.

* Electro Traveler specifically can be a great Superconduct support for Eula if additional Energy generation is required for Eula’s Elemental Burst.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_zhongli.png) 

* Zhongli's Shield can prevent Eula from being interrupted, which lets her more easily stack hits for her Burst.
* His Shield also further debuffs Enemy Resistances, making Eula's attacks stronger.

## **Does Not Work Well With**

\*\*\*\*![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_mona.png) ****

* Mona’s Omen debuff from her Elemental Burst does not last long enough for Eula to finish stacking hits for her Elemental Burst for its full duration.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_chongyun.png) 

* Eula's kit innately favors Physical damage. Chongyun's elemental skill converts Eula's Normal Attacks to Cryo damage, which negates her build's Physical damage bonuses.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/element_anemo.webp) 

* Anemo buffs and debuffs do not affect Physical damage. Anemo characters can still be used for their crowd control and utility but should generally be avoided.

* Compared to a Oneshot team, this team focuses more on giving Eula higher sustained DPS and Burst uptime with the addition of Diona as a Cryo Energy Battery.

* A very basic and straightforward Burst Eula team, focused on buffing Eula as much as possible and debuffing enemies for a more powerful Lightfall Sword.
