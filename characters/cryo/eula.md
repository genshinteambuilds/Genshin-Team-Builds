# Eula

## **Roles**

* **Main DPS**
* **Burst DPS**

## **Character Breakdown**

* Eula relies on her **Elemental Burst, Skill** and **Normal Attacks** to deal **Physical DMG**.
* **Elemental Skill** changes based on whether it is tapped or held.
  * **Elemental Skill (Tap)** deals **Cryo DMG** and gains Eula a stack of Grimheart.
    * Grimheart increases Eula's **DEF** and Resistance to interruption. A maximum of two stacks can be held.
  * **Elemental Skill (Hold)** consumes all Grimheart stacks, deals **Cryo DMG**, and activates the following effects:
    * Each stack of Grimheart consumed creates an instance of **AoE** **Cryo** **DMG**.
    * If any Grimheart stacks are consumed, surrounding enemies will have their **Physical** and **Cryo Resistance** debuffed.
    * At **A4**, if two stacks of Grimheart are consumed, Eula will create a miniature version of her **Elemental Burst** which explodes instantly, dealing **Physical** **DMG**.
* **Elemental Burst** first deals **Cryo DMG** to nearby enemies, then creates a **Lightfall Sword** that deals huge **AoE Physical** **DMG** after a set duration, or if Eula is switched out.
  * **Elemental Burst** **DMG** will increase based on how many times Eula hits enemies during its duration.
  * **Elemental Burst** grants a stack of Grimheart and resets the cooldown of her **Elemental Skill**. As such, Eula should generally always use her **Elemental Skill (Tap)** before using her **Elemental Burst**.

## **Additional Notes**

* Eula’s **Elemental Burst** does NOT **snapshot**.
  * This makes short-lasting buffs much less useful for her **Elemental Burst** **DMG**.
* The typical rotation for Eula's **Elemental Burst** setup is:
  * `E → Q → NA → NA → NA → NA → E (Hold) → NA → NA → NA → NA`
  * where: `NA` = **Normal Attack** `E` = **Elemental Skill** `Q` = **Elemental Burst**

## **Works Well With**

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Shougun.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Fischl.png)

* Often paired with Eula to form a [**Physical** ](../../teams/physical-cryo.md)team.
* Raiden Shogun provides **Superconduct**, buffs **Elemental Burst** **DMG**, serves as an Energy Battery and is able to be used on-field after Eula uses her **Elemental Burst**.
* Fischl provides off-field **Electro DMG**, constant **Superconduct**, and serves as an **Electro** Battery.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Diona.png)

* Diona is a popular option as a **Cryo** healer for Eula as she activates **Cryo Resonance** and provides **Cryo Energy Particles** alongside her healing and shielding.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Rosaria.png)

* Rosaria serves as a **Cryo** Energy Battery and **CRIT Rate** Buffer while also activating **Cryo Resonance**.
* **C6** reduces **Physical Resistance** of enemies hit by Rosaria's **Elemental Burst**.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Zhongli.png)

* Zhongli's shield can prevent Eula from being **interrupted**, which lets her more easily build up hits for her **Elemental Burst**.
* His shield also further Debuffs **Elemental** and **Physical Resistances** of enemies.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)

* Bennett provides a high **ATK** buff that lasts the full duration of Eula's **Elemental Burst** and is a **Healer**.
* **C6** will infuse Eula's **Normal**/**Charged**/**Plunging Attacks** with **Pyro**, negating all of the **Physical** **DMG** bonuses she receives. Do not use C6 Bennett with Eula unless you are going for an **Elemental Burst** Oneshot.
* Note that since Eula's **Elemental Burst** does not snapshot, Eula's **Elemental Burst** must finish within the duration of Bennett's **Elemental Burst** or a large amount of damage is lost.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Lisa.png)

* Lisa works well to support a Eula focused on her **Elemental Burst** **DMG**. She can apply **Superconduct**, debuff **DEF**, hold the **Thrilling Tales of Dragonslayer’s Catalyst**, and use the **Noblesse Oblige** set.
* Her high energy cost **Elemental Burst** and high **Energy Recharge** requirements make her more suitable for one rotation team compositions rather than consistent continuous rotation team compositions unless also paired with Raiden.

## **Does Not Work Well With**

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Mona.png)

* Mona’s **Omen** Debuff from her **Elemental Burst** does not last long enough for Eula to finish stacking hits for her **Elemental Burst** for its full duration.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Chongyun.png)

* Eula's kit innately favors **Physical** **DMG**. Chongyun's **Elemental Skill** converts Eula's **Normal Attacks** to **Cryo** **DMG**, which negates her build's **Physical** **DMG Bonuses**.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Anemo.webp)

* **Anemo** buffs and debuffs do not affect **Physical** **DMG**. **Anemo** characters can still be used for their **Crowd Control** and utility but should generally be avoided.

[**Oneshot**](../../teams/oneshot.md)

* A very basic and straightforward **Elemental Burst** Eula team, focused on buffing Eula as much as possible and Debuffing enemies for a more powerful Lightfall Sword.

[**Physical (Cryo)**](../../teams/physical-cryo.md)

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Eula.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Shougun.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Rosaria.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Diona.png)

* This team focuses on giving Eula high sustained damage and **Elemental Burst** uptime.
* Raiden Shogun, Rosaria, and Diona serve as an Energy Battery for Eula making this team very consistent with **Elemental Burst** uptime.
* Rosaria is able to provide team **CRIT Rate** buffs and reduce enemy **Physical Resistance**.
* Raiden Shogun is able to fill in On-Field during the downtime when Eula's **Elemental Burst** is still on cooldown.
