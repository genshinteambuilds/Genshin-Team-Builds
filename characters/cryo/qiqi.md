# Qiqi

## Roles

* **Support:** Healer

## Character Breakdown

* **Elemental** **Skill** periodically heals the active character, and occasionally attacks surrounding enemies within melee range. Attacking enemies with Qiqi's **Normal** or **Charged** Attacks while the **Elemental Skill** is active will heal all members in the party.
* **Elemental Burst** deals **Cryo DMG** and marks enemies hit with a Fortune Talisman for a duration. Attacking an enemy marked with a talisman will heal the active character.
* **A1** boosts the **Incoming Healing Bonus** of characters affected by Qiqi's **Elemental** **Skill** whenever they trigger an **Elemental Reaction**.
* **A4** gives Qiqi's **Normal** and **Charged Attacks** has a 50% chance to apply a **Fortune** **Talisman** identical to the ones from her **Elemental Burst** to an enemy for 6 seconds. This can only occur once every 30 seconds.

## Additional Notes

* Marking enemies with a Fortune Talisman is Qiqis primary way to heal characters. While Qiqi can use her **Normal Attacks** to heal, it is not recommended as this requires Qiqi to be active instead of your Main DPS character.
* **Elemental Skill** applies **Cryo** extremely slowly (about once every 4-5 seconds), making her only useful for **Elemental Reactions** in **Superconduct** teams.
* **C6** causes her **Elemental Burst** to revive all fallen party members with 50% of their **HP**. This can only activate once every 15 minutes.

## Works Well With

* Qiqi can help to enable **Cryo resonance** for increased **CRIT Rate** against enemies affected by **Cryo.**

* Qiqi works fairly well with a **Physical** Main DPS, as she can periodically apply **Cryo** with her **Elemental skill** to enable **Superconduct** to debuff enemy **Physical RES**.

## Does Not Work Well With

{% hint style="danger" %}
Qiqi provides very little utility outside of healing and cannot generate energy with her Elemental Skill.

While she can be used on any team composition that is looking for a Healer, Qiqi is often only used when no other options are available.

{% hint style="warning" %}
This character is a Healer. While some teams are provided below where they are particularly useful, this character can be used on any team provided you do not have better healing options.

* Qiqi acts as a Healer as well as a second **Cryo** character on this team to trigger **Cryo Resonance**. Note that this team, often called Morgana, typically uses Diona over Qiqi as Diona provides more utility.

[**Physical (Electro)**](../../teams/physical.md)

* Qiqi applies **Cryo** to allow for **Superconduct** for prolonged durations, as well as providing consistent healing to the character on field.
