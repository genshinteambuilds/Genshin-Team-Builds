# Qiqi

## Roles

* **Support:** Healer

## Character Breakdown

* Elemental Skill periodically heals the active character, and occasionally attacks surrounding enemies. When attacking enemies with Qiqi during its active period, it heals all members in the party.
* Elemental Burst tags enemies hit with a talisman for a duration, hitting the marked enemy with the active character will heal them.
* Ascension 1 causes triggering a reaction to boost healing bonus by 20% for a character is affected by her Elemental Skill.
* Ascension 4 gives a 50% chance to apply the mark from her Elemental Burst on to an enemy for 6s with her auto attacks (30s cooldown).

## Additional Notes

* Her Elemental Burst's mark is her main way of healing characters, while she can use her normal attacks to heal, it is not recommended as this requires Qiqi to be active instead of your main damage dealer.
* Her Elemental Skill applies Cryo extremely slowly (about 1 time per 4-5s), making her only useful in Superconduct teams.
* Constellation 6 causes her Elemental Burst to revive all fallen party members with 50% of their health. This can only activate every 15 minutes.

## Works Well With

* Qiqi can help to enable Cryo resonance for increased Critical Rate against enemies affected by Cryo

* She works fairly well with Razor, as she can periodically apply Cryo with her Elemental skill to enable Superconduct to lower enemy Physical Resistance, which Razor greatly benefits from.

## Does Not Work Well With

{% hint style="danger" %}
Qiqi provides very little utility outside of healing and cannot generate energy with her Elemental Skill.

While she can be used on any team composition that is looking for a healer, Qiqi is often only used when no other options are available.&#x20;

## Teams
