# Qiqi

## Roles

* **Support:** Healer

## Character Breakdown

* Elemental Skill periodically heals the active character, and occasionally attacks surrounding enemies. When attacking enemies with Qiqi during its active period, it heals all members in the party.
* Elemental Burst tags enemies hit with a talisman for a duration, hitting the marked enemy with the active character will heal them.
* Ascension 1 causes triggering a reaction to boost healing bonus by 20% for a character is affected by her Elemental Skill.
* Ascension 4 gives a 50% chance to apply the mark from her Elemental Burst on to an enemy for 6s with her auto attacks (30s cooldown).

## Additional Notes

* Her Elemental Burst's mark is her main way of healing characters, while she can use her normal attacks to heal, it is not recommended as this requires Qiqi to be active instead of your main damage dealer.
* Her Elemental Skill applies Cryo extremely slowly (about 1 time per 4-5s), making her only useful in Superconduct teams.
* Constellation 6 causes her Elemental Burst to revive all fallen party members with 50% of their health. This can only activate every 15 minutes.

## Works Well With

* Qiqi can help to enable Cryo resonance for increased Critical Rate against enemies affected by Cryo

* She works fairly well with Razor, as she can periodically apply Cryo with her Elemental skill to enable Superconduct to lower enemy Physical Resistance, which Razor greatly benefits from.

## Does Not Work Well With

As a healer, she can fit in most team compositions that require healing.

* Note that outside of healing, she provides minimal team utility and does not produce Energy with her Elemental Skill. Thus, she can often be replaced by other healers who can provide more than just healing (most notably Diona for sharing her element) to the team, resulting in an overall stronger team composition.

## Teams

{% hint style="warning" %}
This character is a healer. While some teams are provided below where they are particularly useful, this character can be used on any team provided you do not have better healing options.

* Razor acts as the teams Main DPS, making use of the Superconduct reaction to do damage.
* Kaeya provides an additional source of Cryo application as well as activates Cryo resonance.&#x20;
* Fischl generates Electro particles to help fuel Razor's Elemental Burst.
* Qiqi applies Cryo to allow for Superconduct for prolonged durations, as well as provides consistent healing to the character on field.

[**Freeze**](../../teams/freeze.md)

{% hint style="warning" %}
While Qiqi could potentially function as a part of a Freeze team, it is not recommended as she provides very little to the team outside of being a second Cryo member.&#x20;

* Childe acts as this team's Main DPS, constantly applying hydro to enemies.
* Kaeya is the main source of Cryo application, which allows for the Freeze reaction to occur.
* Kazuha applies Viridescent Venerer to debuff enemy resistances, as well as provides his elemental damage buff to teammates.
* Qiqi acts as a healer as well as a second Cryo for the team.
