# Qiqi

## Roles

* Support \(Healer\)

## Character Breakdown

* For Qiqi, Her Elemental Burst \(Talismans\) are her main form of healing.
* Her standard AA \(Ancient Sword Art\) performs a 5 strike combo.
* Elemental Skill \(Herald of Frost\) periodically heals the active character \(making it good for off-field support\), and occasionally attacks surrounding enemies. When attacking enemies with qiqi during its active period, it heals all members in the party.
* Elemental Burst \(Preserver of Fortune\) tags enemies hit with a talisman for a duration, hitting the marked enemy with the active character will heal them.
* Her first passive \(Life-Prolonging Methods\) is when her Elemental Skill is active, triggering a reaction boosts healing bonus by 20%
* Her second passive \(A Glimpse into Arcanum\) gives a 50% chance to apply the talisman on an enemy for 6s with her auto attacks \(30s cooldown\).
* Honestly she just heals and excels at it, nothing much for that.

## Additional Notes

* Her talismans \(Elemental Burst\) are her main way of healing characters, while she can AA to heal, it is not worth sacrificing the time to damage enemies with your main dps characters.
* Her Elemental Skill applies cryo extremely slowly \(about 1 time per 4-5s\), making her only useful in superconduct teams.
* Just like Barbara, at c6 she is able to revive a down character every 15 mins.
* Her constellations are generally regarded as bad, c0 qiqi is enough for healing

## Works Well With

* If you have no other choice for another cryo character, qiqi is a substitute for the cryo resonance party setup.

* Her best synergy is with Razor, as she allows him to activate Superconduct, which is Razor’s main reaction

## Does Not Work Well With

Nothing, she’s a healer, she works in any comp as long as you require healing.

## Teams

[Physical](../../teams/physical.md)

* Her best synergy, Qiqi heals him with her E off field and is able to activate superconduct reactions for Razor
* Since she applies Cryo so slowly, this is her most effective team comp as it relies entirely on superconduct

[Freeze](../../teams/freeze.md)

* Alternate team composition you can try if you don’t have Razor
* Childe’s hydro melee attacks apply hydro that allows Qiqi to freeze them with her E, thus allowing Childe to attack without knocking them away
* Wouldn’t recommend it as highly as a Superconduct team however, as the cryo application is too slow.
