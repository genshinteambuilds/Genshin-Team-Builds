# Qiqi

## Roles

* \*\*Support: \*\*Healer

## Character Breakdown

* Elemental Skill and Burst (Talismans) both provide some form of healing.
* Her standard AA (Ancient Sword Art) performs a 5 strike combo.
* Elemental Skill (Herald of Frost) periodically heals the active character (making it good for off-field support), and occasionally attacks surrounding enemies. When attacking enemies with Qiqi during its active period, it heals all members in the party.
* Elemental Burst (Preserver of Fortune) tags enemies hit with a talisman for a duration, hitting the marked enemy with the active character will heal them.
* Her first passive (Life-Prolonging Methods) is when her Elemental Skill is active, triggering a reaction boosts healing bonus by 20%
* Her second passive (A Glimpse into Arcanum) gives a 50% chance to apply the talisman on an enemy for 6s with her auto attacks (30s cooldown).

## Additional Notes

* Her talismans (Elemental Burst) are her main way of healing characters, while she can AA to heal, it is not worth sacrificing the time to damage enemies with your main dps characters.
* Her Elemental Skill applies cryo extremely slowly (about 1 time per 4-5s), making her only useful in superconduct teams.
* Just like Barbara, at c6 she is able to revive a fallen character every 15 mins.
* Her constellations are generally regarded as somewhat mediocre, c0 Qiqi is often a more than sufficient healer

## Works Well With

* Can enable Cryo resonance for increased Crit Rate against enemies affected by Cryo

* Her best synergy is with Razor, as she can periodically apply Cryo with her Elemental skill to enable Superconduct to lower enemy Physical Resistance.

## Does Not Work Well With

Can fit into most team compositions as she is a powerful healer.

* Note that outside of healing, she provides minimal team utility and does not produce Energy with her Elemental Skill. Can often be replaced by other healers that can provide more than just healing, i.e. Diona.

## Teams

{% hint style="warning" %}
This character is a healer. While some teams are provided below where they are particularly useful, this character can be used on any team provided you do not have better healing options.

[**Physical**](../../teams/physical.md)\*\*\*\*

* Slowly applies Cryo to allow for Superconduct for prolonged durations, as well as provides consistent healing to the character on field.

[**Freeze**](../../teams/freeze.md)\*\*\*\*

* Alternate team composition you can try if you don’t have Razor
* Childe’s hydro melee attacks apply hydro that allows Qiqi to freeze them with her Elemental Skill, thus allowing Childe to attack without knocking them away
* Wouldn’t recommend it as highly as a Superconduct team however, as the Cryo application is too slow.
