# Qiqi

## Roles

* **Support:** Healer

## Character Breakdown

* **Elemental** Skill periodically heals the active character, and occasionally attacks surrounding enemies. Attacking enemies with Qiqi's **Normal **or **Charged **Attacks while the **Elemental Skill **is active will heal** **all members in the party.
* **Elemental Burst **deals **Cryo **damage and marks enemies hit with a **Fortune** **Talisman **for a duration, attacking an enemy with this will heal** **the active character.
* **A1 **boosts the **Incoming Healing Bonus **of characters affected by Qiqi's **Elemental** **Skill **whenever they trigger an **Elemental Reaction**.
* **A4 **gives Qiqi's **Normal **and **Charged Attacks **has a 50% chance to apply a **Fortune** **Talisman **identical to the ones from her **Elemental Burst **to an enemy for 6 seconds. This can only occur once every 30 seconds.

## Additional Notes

* Her **Elemental** **Burst's **mark is her main way of **healing **characters, while she can use her **normal attacks **to heal, it is not recommended as this requires Qiqi to be active instead of your main damage dealer.
* Her **Elemental Skill **applies **Cryo **extremely slowly (about 1 time per 4-5s), making her only useful in **Superconduct **teams.
* **C6 **causes her **Elemental Burst **to **revive **all fallen party members with 50% of their **HP**. This can only activate every 15 minutes.

## Works Well With

* Qiqi can help to enable **Cryo resonance **for increased **Critical Rate **against enemies affected by **Cryo.**

* She works fairly well with a **Physical** Main DPS, as she can periodically apply **Cryo **with her **Elemental skill **to enable **Superconduct **to debuff enemy **Physical Resistance**, which they greatly benefit from.

## Does Not Work Well With

{% hint style="danger" %}
Qiqi provides very little utility outside of healing and cannot generate energy with her Elemental Skill.

While she can be used on any team composition that is looking for a healer, Qiqi is often only used when no other options are available.&#x20;

* Qiqi acts as a healer as well as a second **Cryo **for the team to increase **Critical Rate **on-hit on enemies affected by **Cryo **or **Frozen**.

* Qiqi applies **Cryo **to allow for **Superconduct **for prolonged durations, as well as providing consistent healing** **to the character on field.
