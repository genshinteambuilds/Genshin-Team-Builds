# Tighnari

## Roles

* **Burst DPS**
* **Main DPS**

## **Character Breakdown**

* Tighnari's **Charged Attack Damage** and **Elemental Burst** gain additional damage based off of his **Elemental Mastery.**
* **Charged Attack,** upon being fully charged, launches an arrow that, upon hitting an enemy, causes four additional arrows to hit nearby enemies with **Dendro** damage.
* **Elemental Skill** deals **AoE Dendro** damage, and leaves a field which taunts enemies and drastically lowers **Charged Attack** charge-up time for up to three shots.
* **Elemental Burst** fires off a wave of **Dendro** arrows, which spawn a second wave of arrows after hitting an enemy.

## **Additional Notes**

* Tighnari is typically only used in bursts, by switching her in to use her **Elemental Skill, Elemental Burst,** and use her three sped-up **Charged Attacks** before switching out. Her damage decreases drastically past this point and it is recommended to switch to another character.
* Tighnari teams typically rely heavily on the **Aggravate** and **Spread** reactions to do a large portion of the team's overall damage.

## Works Well With

* **Electro Burst DPS** are very valuable members of the team, as they can help trigger the **Aggravate** and **Spread** reactions, as well as act as an on-field damage dealer outside of Tighnari's limited damage window.

* Fischl's **Elemental Skill** provides the constant **Electro** application to help trigger the **Dendro** reactions, as well as provide a fair amount of supporting damage.

* Zhongli's large shield provided by his **Elemental Skill** provides a large amount of safety while charging up Tignhari's **Charged Attack.** In addition, his **Elemental Skill** lowers enemy **Dendro** resistances.

* Both characters provide additional energy to Tighnari to keep good **Elemental Burst** uptime. This is only needed if Fischl is not run in the team.
* Being **Dendro** characters, they complete the **Dendro** resonance pairing with Tighnari.

## Does Not Work Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_icon\_pyro.webp)

* **Burning** did not turn out to be a great source of damage and should not be considered a viable team for Tighnari.

* With the lack of off-field and consistent **Dendro** application, running a **Bloom/Hyper-Bloom** team is also not recommended for Tighnari.

Note: This does not mean having characters with those elements should be avoided. However, their corresponding reactions should not be focused on or prioritized

* Tighnari and Yae share the role of on-field damage dealer, triggering the **Spread** and **Aggravate** reactions respectively.
* Yae and Fischl's **Elemental Skills** make sure that the enemy is marked with **Electro** at all times.
* Tighnari is the team's source of **Dendro** to apply the **Quicken** reaction to allow for **Spread** and **Aggravate** to be triggered.
* Zhongli keeps the team shielded and provides **Elemental Resistance reduction** debuff.&#x20;

* Tighnari is the team's on-field damage dealer and primarily relies on his **Charged Attack** to trigger **Spread**.
* Collei helps generate **Dendro** particles and provides **Elemental Mastery** via **Dendro Resonance.**
* Fischl's **Elemental Skill** is responsible for keeping enemies marked with the **Quicken** reaction to allow for **Spread**.
* Sucrose provides **Elemental Mastery** to the team and can fill downtime with **Swirl.**
