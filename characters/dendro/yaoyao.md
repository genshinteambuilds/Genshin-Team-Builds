# Yaoyao

## Roles

* **Support**: Healer
* **Off-Field DPS**

## Character Breakdown

* **Elemental Skill** summons Yuegui: Throwing Mode, a NPC that throws White Jade Radishes that deal **Dendro DMG** to enemies and heals allies within its explosion area. This NPC remains on field even if Yaoyao is switched out.
  * Yuegui prioritizes healing characters below 70% health before targetting enemies.
  * Radishes that do not explode remain on the ground until triggered by nearby characters or enemies.
* **Elemental Burst** empowers Yaoyao, causing the Radishes spawned by her **Elemental Skill** to have much better scaling and is treated as **Elemental Burst** damage. In addition, she periodically summons Yuegui: Jumping Mode which behave the same as the Yuegui from her **Elemental Skill**. She also gains some movement speed and **Dendro RES.**&#x20;

## Additional Notes&#x20;

* Yaoyao's **Elemental Skill** and **Elemental Burst**'s healing scale based on her **Max HP.**
* **C1** buffs allies hit by the Radish's explosions with bonus **Dendro DMG.**
* **C4** provides her with **Elemental Mastery** based on her **Max HP.**
* She can be built prioritizing **Max HP** for higher healing, or with primarily **Elemental Mastery**, to increase her **Elemental Reaction** damage.

* As a **Dendro** user, Yaoyao is ideally paired with other Elements that create **Dendro**-related reactions such as **Bloom**, **Hyperbloom**, **Burgeon**, **Burning**, **Spread**, and **Aggravate**.&#x20;
  * Yaoyao is a **Dendro** healer with high on and off field **Dendro** application allowing her to fit in most **Dendro** **Reaction** focused teams.

## Does Not Work Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_icon\_geo.webp)

* **Geo** does not react with **Dendro** and outside of Zhongli, almost no **Geo** characters provide any benefit to the **Dendro** focused teams Yaoyao primarily features in.
