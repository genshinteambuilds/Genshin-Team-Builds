# Al-Haitham

## Roles

* **On-Field DPS**

## Character Breakdown

* **Elemental Skill** deals **Dendro DMG** and creates a Chisel-Light Mirror. An additional Mirror is created if Al-Haitham has none when using his **Elemental Skill**.
  * Chisel-Light Mirrors last for 4 seconds each and grant Al-Haitham various bonuses.
    * When any number of Mirrors is active, Al-Haitham gains a **Dendro** infusion.
    * Al-Haithams **Normal, Charged,** and **Plunging Attacks** will create additional **Dendro DMG** attacks up to every 1.6 seconds, dealing damage based on the number of active mirrors.
* **Elemental Burst** deals **AoE Dendro DMG** and consumes all of Al-Haitham's Chisel-Light Mirrors, dealing additional damage for each Mirror consumed.
  * If used when 0 Chisel-Light Mirrors are active, **Elemental Burst** creates two.
* **A1** creates a Chisel-Light Mirror when hitting enemies with **Charged** or **Plunging Attacks** up to once every 12 seconds.
* **A4** increases the damage dealt by Al-Haitham's **Elemental Burst** and additional the attacks caused by Chisel-Light Mirrors by .1% per point of **Elemental Mastery,** up to 100%.

## Additional Notes

* Al-Haitham's high **Dendro** application and natural scaling with **Elemental Mastery** makes him a natural fit for teams which rely on **Dendro Elemental Reactions**.

* Al-Haitham deals consistent On-Field **AoE Dendro DMG** and can supply the **Dendro** needed for related reactions such as **Spread**, **Aggravate**, **Bloom**, **Hyperbloom**, **Burning,** and **Burgeon**.&#x20;
  * Al-Haitham's natural scaling with **Elemental Mastery** makes him even more effective as an On-Field **Dendro** applicator.
* Al-Haitham can be paired with another **Dendro** unit for **Dendro Resonance** and to provide energy.

## Does Not Work Well With&#x20;

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_icon\_cryo.webp)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_icon\_geo.webp)

* **Cryo** and **Geo** cannot react with **Dendro** and have minimal effect on any **Dendro**-related team composition.
  * **Dendro's** powerful **Elemental Reactions** and Al-Haitham's natural tendency to build **Elemental Mastery** to empower those reactions makes running elements which have no **Elemental Reactions** with **Dendro** a high opportunity cost.&#x20;
