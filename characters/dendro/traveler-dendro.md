  * **Hydro** : Increases the **AoE** of the effect and the **AoE** of its attacks.
  * **Electro** : Increases the **ATK SPD** of the Lamp.
  * **Pyro** : After a short delay, the Lamp will explode, disappearing and dealing **AoE Dendro DMG**.
* The Lea Lotus Lamp can only have one transfiguration in its duration.
* **A1**: The **Elemental Burst** will obtain one stack every second it is on the field, increasing the **Elemental Mastery** of the active character inside by 6. Max 10 stacks.
* **A4**: **Elemental Mastery** increases the **DMG** dealt by Traveler (Dendro)'s **Elemental Skill** and **Elemental Burst**.

## **Additional Notes**

* **C6**: The character under effect of **Elemental Burst** will obtain 12% **Dendro DMG** bonus. If the Lea Lotus Lamp was transformed, also obtain 12% **Elemental DMG** of the element that caused it.
* Should be paired with a **Dendro Energy Battery** to help charge their **Elemental Burst**.
