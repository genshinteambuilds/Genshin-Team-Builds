# Collei

## Roles

* **Off-Field DPS** (Elemental Burst)
* **Support:** Buffer (C4)

## Character Breakdown

* **Elemental Skill** throws out a Floral Ring that deals **Dendro DMG** that returns to Collei dealing another instance of **Dendro DMG** for a total of 2 instances of **Dendro** application.
* **Elemental Burst** throws a doll named Cuilein-Anbar causing an explosion that deals **Dendro DMG** and creates a Cuilein-Anbar zone. Cuilein-Anbar will bounce around this zone dealing **AoE Dendro DMG**.
* **A1**: After using Collei's **Elemental Skill**, if any party member triggers a **Dendro**-related reaction before the Floral Ring returns, the active character will be granted the Sprout effect upon return. This effect will deal continuous **AoE Dendro DMG** equivalent to 40% of Collei's **ATK** for 3s.
* **A4**: After using Collei's **Elemental Burst**, when a character within the Cuilein-Anbar zone triggers a **Dendro**-related reaction, the Zone's duration will be extended by 1s. The total duration can be extended by up to 3s.

## Additional Notes

* **C1:** When in the party and not the active character, Collei's **Energy Recharge** is increased by 20%.
* **C2:** From the moment of using Collei's **Elemental Skill** to when the Sprout Effect ends, if any party member triggers a **Dendro**-related reaction, the Sprout Effect duration is extended by 3s.
* **C4:** Using Collei's **Elemental Burst** will increase all party members' **Elemental Mastery** by 60 for 12s (excluding Collei herself).
* Collei should generally be paired with another **Dendro Support** such as Traveler (Dendro) in order to maintain constant **Dendro** application on enemies, as her **Elemental Burst's** duration is very short.

* Collei deals constant **AoE Dendro DMG** and can supply the **Dendro** needed for related reactions such as **Spread**, **Aggravate**, **Bloom**, **Hyperbloom**, **Burning,** and **Burgeon**.&#x20;
  * Collei's **Elemental Burst** makes up most of Collei's **DMG** and **Dendro** application. Utilizing Collei's **A4** will be needed to extend her **Elemental Burst** duration from 6s to 9s.
  * Her **Elemental Skill** and the Sprout Effect from her **A1** can apply **Dendro** to enemies during Collei's **Elemental Burst** cooldown. The amount of **Dendro** application can be further increased by using an **R3**+ Sacrificial Bow which also provides more energy at the cost of having Collei spend more time as the active character in a rotation.&#x20;
* Collei can be paired with another **Dendro** unit for **Dendro Resonance** and to provide energy.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_icon\_anemo.webp)

* **Dendro** cannot be swirled but for a team based on **Dendro**-related **Elemental Reactions**, an **Anemo Support** using **4pc** **Viridescent Venerer** to amplify the **DMG** of the other elements is recommended to increase the overall DPS of the team with Collei as a **Dendro** support.
  * **Anemo** is a lot less effective in a team where Collei is triggering **Spread** reactions due to **Dendro DMG** being the main **DMG** source in such a team which cannot be swirled.

## Does Not Work Well With&#x20;

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_icon\_cryo.webp)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_icon\_geo.webp)

* **Cryo** and **Geo** cannot react with **Dendro** and have minimal effect on any **Dendro**-related team composition.
  * **Dendro** is an element that heavily requires **Elemental Reactions** to be useful therefore it is not recommended to pair Collei with anyone that doesn't contribute anything towards triggering or amplifying **Dendro Reactions**.
  * **Cryo** has a use case in 'Fridge' teams. Since **Cryo** doesn't react with **Dendro**, Blooms can be created from **Dendro** reacting with the **Hydro** aura on **Frozen** enemies. This team requires Collei to continuously apply **Dendro** as the active character.
