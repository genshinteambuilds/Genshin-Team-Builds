# Nahida

## Roles

* **Support**: Buffer (A1), Debuffer (C2)
* **Off-Field DPS**
* **Main DPS**: (See Additional Notes)

## Character Breakdown

* **Elemental Skill (tap)** deals **Dendro** damage and applies **Dendro** to nearby opponents.&#x20;
* **Elemental Skill (hold)** allows the player to enter aiming mode and hit a limited number of enemies selected within this mode.&#x20;
  * Enemies hit by Nahida's **Elemental Skill** are marked by the Seed of Skandha which will link up with another nearby enemy and deals additional **Dendro** damage to linked opponents when they take damage from a **Dendro** Core; this is called Tri-Karma Purification.
  * The Seed of Skandha stays on the enemy even whilst Nahida is off-field which allows Nahida to be an **Off-field DPS**.
* **Elemental Burst** creates a large **AoE** known as the Shrine of Maya. This provides buffs within the **AoE** depending on the Elemental Types within the party. The effects of these buffs increase further based on the associated number of Elemental Types:
  * **Pyro**: Tri-Karma Purification damage from Nahida's **Elemental Skill** is increased.
  * **Electro**: The cooldown of Tri-Karma Purification is decreased.
  * **Hydro**: Shrine of Maya duration is increased.
* **A1**: Upon casting **Elemental Burst**, the active character within the Shrine of Maya gains **Elemental Mastery** equivalent to 25% of that of the party member with the highest **Elemental Mastery** up to an increase of 250.
* **A4**: Nahida's Tri-Karma Purification gains **DMG%** scaling from her **Elemental Mastery**.

## Additional Notes

* **C2**: Activates on enemies affected by the Seed of Skandha. Allows **Dendro**-related reaction damage that cannot typically deal **CRIT DMG** to score **CRIT** hits at a fixed rate of 20% **CRIT Rate** and 100% **CRIT DMG**. Also reduces the **DEF** of enemies by 30% when affected by **Quicken**, **Aggravate**, or **Spread,** letting Nahida act as a **Debuffer**.
* **C6**: When using **Normal** or **Charged Attacks** on enemies affected by the Seed of Skandha after using her **Elemental Burst**, Nahida deals **Dendro** damage based on 200% of her **ATK** and 400% of her **Elemental Mastery**. This can be triggered every 0.2s for 10s or after 6 of these instances of **Dendro** damage. This incentivizes Nahida to be used on-field as a **Main DPS**.
* With enough **Elemental Mastery** (900+), Nahida can be used as an on-field driver for **Dendro**-based reactions. Her **A4** passive also scales from her **Elemental Mastery,** increasing her on-field **** damage **** and making her more viable as a **Main DPS** role, especially at **C6**.
* Despite the large gains in personal **** damage from her **C6** and **A4** passive, Nahida still generally does not provide a large portion of her team's **** damage **** so it is still recommended to use her in a **Support** role.

* As a **Dendro** user, Nahida is ideally paired with other Elements that create **Dendro**-related reactions such as **Bloom**, **Hyperbloom**, **Burgeon**, **Burning**, **Spread**, and **Aggravate**.&#x20;
  * As a **Catalyst** user, Nahida can effectively apply **Dendro** on-field using **Normal Attacks** and with her **Elemental Skill**. Her **Elemental Skill** can also apply **Dendro** Off-field on enemies marked by the Seed of Skandha.
  * Nahida's **Elemental Burst** scales with **Hydro**, **Electro**, and **Pyro** characters.
  * She can be paired with another **Dendro** character to provide the team with **Dendro** resonance and act as a battery for **Dendro** particles.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_icon\_anemo.webp)

* Despite **Dendro** being unable to react with **Anemo**, Nahida's non-**Dendro** teammates may benefit greatly from the **Elemental RES** debuff provided by the **4pc Viridescent Venerer (VV)** artifact set. This is especially true when Nahida is just being used as an Off-Field **Support** so other Elements deal a higher percentage of the team's damage.&#x20;

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_icon\_cryo.webp)

* **Cryo** can be utilized with **Dendro** through **Freeze**. As the **Hydro** aura stays on **Frozen** enemies, **Blooms** can be created by applying **Dendro** on them. The enemies will stay **Frozen** as **Dendro** will not react with **Cryo** and so allows for more manageable enemy grouping in what's known as a 'Fridge' team composition (niche [**Bloom**](../../teams/anemo-1.md) **** team variant).

## Does Not Work Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_icon\_geo.webp)

* **Geo** does not react with **Dendro**. **Geo** has little to no use cases with **Dendro**, unlike **Anemo** and **Cryo** which can benefit **Dendro** indirectly. **Geo** characters will need to have another supporting utility like Zhongli's **Elemental RES** shred via his shield from his **Elemental Skill** to be paired with Nahida.
