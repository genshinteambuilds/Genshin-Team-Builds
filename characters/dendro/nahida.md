# Nahida

## Roles

* **Support**: Buffer (A1), Debuffer (C2)
* **Off-Field DPS**
* **Main DPS**: (See Additional Notes)

## Character Breakdown

* **Elemental Skill (Tap)** deals **Dendro** damage and applies **Dendro** to nearby opponents.&#x20;
* **Elemental Skill (Hold)** allows the player to enter aiming mode and hit a limited number of enemies selected within this mode.&#x20;
  * Enemies hit by Nahida's **Elemental Skill** are marked by the Seed of Skandha which will link up with another nearby enemy and deals additional **Dendro** damage to linked opponents when they take damage from a **Dendro** Core; this is called Tri-Karma Purification.
  * The Seed of Skandha allows Nahida to be an **Off-Field DPS** as it will stay on enemies.
* **Elemental Burst** creates a large field. Characters standing within the field will receive buffs depending on the Elemental Types present in the party. The effects of these buffs increase further based on the associated number of Elemental Types:
  * **Pyro**: Tri-Karma Purification damage from Nahida's **Elemental Skill** is increased.
  * **Electro**: The cooldown of Tri-Karma Purification is decreased.
  * **Hydro**: **Elemental Burst** duration is increased.
* **A1**: Upon casting **Elemental Burst**, the active character within Nahida's **Elemental Burst** gains **Elemental Mastery** based on the party member with the highest **Elemental Mastery**.
* **A4**: Nahida's Tri-Karma Purification gains **DMG%** scaling from her **Elemental Mastery**.

## Additional Notes

* **C2**: Activates on enemies affected by Nahida's **Elemental Skill**. Allows **Dendro**-related reaction damage that cannot typically deal **CRIT DMG** to score **CRIT** hits at a fixed rate. Also reduces the **DEF** of enemies when affected by **Quicken**, **Aggravate**, or **Spread,** letting Nahida act as a **Debuffer**.
* **C6**: When using **Normal** or **Charged Attacks** on enemies affected by the Seed of Skandha after using her **Elemental Burst**, Nahida deals **Dendro** damage based on her **ATK** and **Elemental Mastery**. Because this effect can be triggered frequently, **C6** incentivizes Nahida to be used as a **Main DPS**.
* With enough **Elemental Mastery** (900+), Nahida can be used to frequently trigger **Dendro**-based reactions with her **Normal** and **Charged** **Attacks**. Her **A4** passive also scales from her **Elemental Mastery,** increasing her **** damage **** and making her more viable as a **Main DPS** role, especially at **C6**.
* Despite the large gains in personal **** damage from her **C6** and **A4** passive, Nahida still generally does not provide a large portion of her team's **** damage **** so it is still recommended to use her in a **Support** role.

* As a **Dendro** user, Nahida is ideally paired with other Elements that create **Dendro**-related reactions such as **Bloom**, **Hyperbloom**, **Burgeon**, **Burning**, **Spread**, and **Aggravate**.&#x20;
  * As a **Catalyst** user, Nahida can effectively apply **Dendro** using **Normal Attacks** and with her **Elemental Skill**. Her **Elemental Skill** can also apply **Dendro** Off-Field to enemies marked by it.
  * Nahida's **Elemental Burst** scales with **Hydro**, **Electro**, and **Pyro** characters.
  * She can be paired with another **Dendro** character to provide the team with **Dendro** **Resonance** and act as a battery for **Dendro** characters.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_icon\_anemo.webp)

* Despite **Dendro** being unable to react with **Anemo**, Nahida's non-**Dendro** teammates may benefit greatly from the **Elemental RES** debuff provided by the **4pc Viridescent Venerer (VV)** artifact set. This is especially true when Nahida is just being used as an Off-Field **Support** so other Elements deal a higher percentage of the team's damage.&#x20;

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_icon\_cryo.webp)

* **Cryo** can be utilized with **Dendro** through **Freeze**. As the **Hydro** aura stays on **Frozen** enemies, **Blooms** can be created by applying **Dendro** on them. The enemies will stay **Frozen** as **Dendro** will not react with **Cryo** and so allows for more manageable enemy grouping in what's known as a 'Fridge' team composition (niche [**Bloom**](../../teams/anemo-1.md) **** team variant).

## Does Not Work Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_icon\_geo.webp)

* **Geo** does not react with **Dendro**. **Geo** has little to no use cases with **Dendro**, unlike **Anemo** and **Cryo** which can benefit **Dendro** indirectly. **Geo** characters will need to have another supporting utility like Zhongli's **Elemental RES** shred via his shield from his **Elemental Skill** to be paired with Nahida.
