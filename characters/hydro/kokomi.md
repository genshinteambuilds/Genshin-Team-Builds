# Kokomi

## Roles

* **Support**: Healer, Cleanser (Self Only)
* **Off-Field DPS** (Elemental Skill)
* **Main DPS** (See Additional Notes/Teams)

## Character Breakdown

* **Elemental Skill** summons a Bake-Kurage, which periodically heals allies, damages enemies in an area, and applies **Hydro**. Applies **Hydro** to Kokomi, which can cleanse some debuffs.
* **Elemental Burst** deals **Hydro Damage** to nearby enemies and causes her **Elemental Skill** and **Normal** and **Charged Attacks** to gain damage based on her **Max** **HP** for a short duration. Additionally, Kokomi gains resistance to interruption and her **Normal** and **Charged Attacks** heal all party members.
* **A1** causes the duration of Kokomi's **Elemental Skill** duration to be refreshed when she uses her **Elemental Burst**.
* **A4** increases the bonus damage gained during Kokomi's **Elemental Burst** by 15% of her **Healing Bonus**.
* Kokomi's 3rd Passive Talent reduces her **CRIT RATE** by 100% in exchange for a 25% increase in **Healing Bonus**.

## **Additional Notes**

* Kokomi's healing scales off **HP.**
* Kokomi's massive **CRIT RATE** reduction from her third passive talent greatly hampers her ability as a traditional Main DPS.
  * Kokomi's high **Hydro** application enables her to be a non-conventional Main DPS in [Electro-Charged (Hydro)](../../teams/electro-charged-hydro.md) teams through frequently triggering reactions.

* Kokomi can work in almost any team in the game as a universal Healer.

## Does Not Work Well With

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Zhongli.png)

* Zhongli's high shielding often reduces the need for Kokomi's healing.
* Zhongliâ€™s **Stone Seele** also triggers **Shatter** reactions on **Frozen** enemies.

* Kokomi's high healing leads to overlap when paired with other characters who primarily heal or shield.

[**Electro-Charged (Hydro)**](../../teams/electro-charged-hydro.md)

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Kokomi.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Beidou.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Fischl.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Kazuha.png)

* Kokomi's high **Hydro** application allows her to be used as a Main DPS in this team to repeatedly trigger **Electro-Charged**.
* Kokomi's massive reduction in **CRIT RATE** allows her to build heavily into **Elemental Mastery**, greatly increasing the damage of **Electro-Charged**.

[**Freeze (Cryo)**](../../teams/freeze.md)

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Ayaka.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Kokomi.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Kazuha.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Shenhe.png)

* Kokomi's **Hydro** application enables permanent **Freeze** from Off-Field.
* Using Kokomi as a **Hydro** applicator can free up a slot that would typically be dedicated to a healer.

[**Vaporize (Hydro)**](../../teams/vaporize.md)

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Kokomi.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xiangling.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Sucrose.png)

* Kokomi can be used as a **Hydro** applicator to **Vaporize** the damage from a **Pyro** Off-Field DPS such as Xiangling.

[**Vaporize (Pyro)**](../../teams/reverse-vaporize.md)

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Diluc.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Kokomi.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Zhongli.png)

* Kokomi can provide enough **Hydro** application to keep up with Diluc's damage, allowing other **Hydro** characters such as Xingqiu who are typically paired with him to be used in other teams.
