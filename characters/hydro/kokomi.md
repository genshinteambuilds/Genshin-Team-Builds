# Kokomi

## Roles

* **Support**: Healer, Cleanser (Self Only)
* **Off-Field DPS** (Elemental Skill)
* **On-Field DPS** (See Additional Notes/Teams)

## Character Breakdown

* **Elemental Skill** summons a Bake-Kurage, which periodically heals allies, damages enemies in an area, and applies **Hydro**. Also applies **Hydro** to Kokomi, which can cleanse some debuffs.
* **Elemental Burst** deals **Hydro DMG** to nearby enemies and causes her **Elemental Skill** and **Normal** and **Charged Attacks** to gain a **DMG Bonus** based on her **Max** **HP** for a short duration. Additionally, Kokomi gains resistance to interruption and her **Normal** and **Charged Attacks** heal all party members.
* **A1** causes the duration of Kokomi's **Elemental Skill** duration to be refreshed when she uses her **Elemental Burst**.
* **A4** increases the **DMG Bonus** gained during Kokomi's **Elemental Burst** by 15% of her **Healing Bonus**.
* Kokomi's 3rd Passive Talent reduces her **CRIT Rate** by 100% in exchange for a 25% increase in **Healing Bonus**.

## **Additional Notes**

* Kokomi's healing scales off **HP.**
* Kokomi's massive **CRIT Rate** reduction from her third passive talent greatly hampers her ability as a traditional On-Field DPS.
  * Kokomi's high **Hydro** application enables her to be a non-conventional On-Field DPS in [**Electro-Charged (Hydro)**](../../teams/electro-charged-hydro.md) teams through frequently triggering reactions.

## **Works Well With**

* Kokomi's **Hydro** application from her **Elemental Skill** and **Normal**/**Charged Attacks** can work together with these characters to permanently keep enemies **Frozen.**

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_beidou.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_fischl.png)

* The high **Electro** application of these characters can allow Kokomi to constantly trigger **Electro-charged** reactions.

* Kokomi's **Hydro** application from her **Normal** and **Charged Attacks** can be used to **Vaporize** Xiangling's **Elemental Skill** and **Burst.**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_nilou.png)****

* Kokomi's high healing pairs well with Nilou in [**Bloom**](../../teams/anemo-1.md) teams, due to the high self-damage caused by the reaction.

* Kokomi can work in almost any team in the game as a universal Healer.

## Does Not Work Well With

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_zhongli.png)

* Zhongli's high shielding often reduces the need for Kokomi's healing.
* Zhongliâ€™s **Stone Seele** also triggers **Shatter** reactions on **Frozen** enemies.

* Kokomi's high healing leads to overlap when paired with other characters who primarily heal or shield.

* Kokomi's high **Hydro** application allows her to be used as a On-Field DPS in this team to repeatedly trigger **Electro-Charged**.
* Kokomi's massive reduction in **CRIT Rate** allows her to build heavily into **Elemental Mastery**, greatly increasing the output of **Electro-Charged Elemental Reactions**.&#x20;

[**Freeze (Cryo)**](../../teams/freeze.md)

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_ayaka.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_kokomi.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_kazuha.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_shenhe.png)

* Kokomi's **Hydro** application enables permanent **Freeze** from Off-Field.
* Using Kokomi as a **Hydro** applicator can free up a slot that would typically be dedicated to a Healer.

[**Vaporize (Hydro)**](../../teams/vaporize.md)

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_kokomi.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_xiangling.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_bennett.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_sucrose.png)

* Kokomi can provide enough **Hydro** application to **Vaporize** Diluc's **Pyro DMG**, allowing other **Hydro** characters such as Xingqiu who are typically paired with him to be used in other teams.

****[**Bloom**](../../teams/anemo-1.md)****

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_nilou.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_traveler\_dendro.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_collei.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_kokomi.png)

* Kokomi can provide both healing and **Hydro** application for **Bloom** teams to help consistently trigger the **Elemental Reaction** and to mitigate the self-damage dealt by it.
