# Nilou

## **Roles**

* **On-Field DPS**
* **Support**: Buffer

## **Character Breakdown**

* **Elemental Skill** changes Nilou's stance, allowing her to deal **AoE** **Hydro** **DMG** for up to 4 attacks before providing a bonus based on which attack is used as its final attack.
  * Using a **Normal Attack** causes Nilou's **Normal Attacks** to deal **AoE** **Hydro** **DMG** for 8 seconds.
  * Using **Elemental Skill** creates an aura that applies **Hydro** around the On-Field character for 12 seconds.
* **Elemental Burst** deals **AoE** **Hydro** **DMG**. This damage is repeated once after a short interval.
* **A1** massively buffs the **Bloom** **Elemental Reaction** after Nilou gains one of the bonuses after her **Elemental Skill**, increasing the explosion radius and shortening the time before **Bloom** cores explode.
  * This buff is only active when the party contains only **Hydro** and **Dendro** characters.
* **A4** increases the **DMG** of the **Bloom** **Elemental Reaction** based on how much **Max HP** Nilou has above 30,000.

## **Additional Notes**

* Nilou's massive buffs to the **Bloom** **Elemental Reaction** make the teams she is used in centered around this reaction. This limits her to typically only being paired with **Hydro** and **Dendro** characters to activate her **A1**.
* The self-damage caused by **Dendro Core** explosions makes a healer necessary for Nilou's **Bloom** teams.

## **Works Well With**

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_icon\_hydro.webp)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_icon\_dendro.webp)

* Nilou's massive bonuses to **Bloom** are only active when exclusively **Hydro** and **Dendro** characters are in the party.

## **Does Not Work Well With**

* Nilou's focus on the **Bloom Elemental Reaction** greatly limits her in teams outside of it. Nilou provides very little to most teams outside of **Bloom** other than a relatively small amount of **Hydro** application and limited **Hydro** **DMG** with her **Elemental Burst**.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** This does not mean that Nilou is unusable in teams outside of **Bloom**, however, other **Hydro** characters will typically provide more in her place.

## **Teams**

* Nilou provides massive buffs to the **Bloom Elemental Reaction**, enabling **Bloom** teams to function.
* Nilou also acts as an On or Off-Field **Hydro** applicator in these teams with her **Elemental Skill** and **Burst**, allowing the team to consistently trigger **Bloom**.
