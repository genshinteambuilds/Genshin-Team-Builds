# Nilou

## **Roles**

* **Main DPS**
* **Support**: Buffer

## **Character Breakdown**

* **A1** massively buffs the **Bloom** **Elemental Reaction**, increasing damage, explosion radius, and shortening the time before **Bloom** cores explode.
  * This buff is only active when the party contains only **Hydro** and **Dendro** characters
* **A4** increases the damage dealt by the **Bloom** **Elemental Reaction** based on how much Max Hp Nilou has above 30,000.
* **Elemental Skill** does AoE **Hydro** damage up to 4 times before providing a bonus based on which attack you use for the fourth attack.
  * Using a **Normal Attack** causes Nilou's **Normal Attacks** to deal AoE **Hydro** damage for 8 seconds.
  * Using **Elemental Skill** creates a **Hydro** applying aura around the On-Field character for 12 seconds.
  * **A1** provides an **Elemental Mastery** bonus after dealing **Dendro** damage while one of these bonuses is active.
* **Elemental Burst** deals AoE **Hydro** damage. This damage is repeated once after a short interval.

## **Additional Notes**

* Nilou's massive buffs to the **Bloom** **Elemental Reaction** makes her main use teams centered around this reaction. This limits her to typically only being paired with **Hydro** and **Dendro** characters to keep her buffs active.
* The self-damage caused by **Bloom** in many Nilou teams makes the need for a healer much larger than many other teams.

## **Works Well With**

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_icon\_hydro.webp)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_icon\_dendro.webp)

* Nilou's massive bonuses to **Bloom** are only active when exclusively **Hydro** and **Dendro** characters are in the party.

## **Does Not Work Well With**

* Nilou's focus on the **Bloom Elemental Reaction** greatly limits her in teams outside of it. Nilou provides very little to most teams outside of **Bloom** other than a relatively small **Hydro** aura and limited **Hydro** damage with her **Elemental Burst**.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** This does not mean that Nilou is unusable in teams outside of **Bloom**, however, other **Hydro** characters will typically provide more in her place.

## **Teams**

* Nilou provides massive buffs to the **Bloom Elemental Reaction**, enabling **Bloom** teams to function.
* Nilou also acts as an On or Off-Field **Hydro** applicator in these teams with her **Elemental Skill** and **Burst**, allowing them to consistently trigger **Bloom**.
