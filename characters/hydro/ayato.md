# Ayato

## Roles

* Main DPS

## Character Breakdown

* **Elemental Skill** allows rapid slashes and leaves an illusion which explodes on contact with enemies or after duration ends, dealing **Hydro DMG**.
  * Gains Namisen stacks that increases Skill **DMG** based on **Max HP**.&#x20;
  * Gains resistance while skill is active.
  * **Charge Attacks** and **Plunging Attacks** disabled.
* **Elemental Burst** creates a field which continually rains on enemies, dealing **Hydro DMG**.&#x20;
* **A1** allows initial skill use and illusion to provide Namisen stacks.
* **A4** provides 2 Energy per second to Ayato while he is off field with less than 40 Energy.

## **Additional Notes**

* Stacking **Max HP** is not encouraged.
* Focus of Ayato's damage is on his **Elemental Skill**.
* **Elemental Skill** does get affected by **ATK SPD** buffs.
* **Elemental Skill** infusion cannot be overridden and will no longer active when Ayato leaves the field.

## Works Well With

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_bennett.png)

* Bennett's **Elemental Burst** provides healing and a massive **ATK** buff, making him a recommended character in most teams.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_xiangling.png)

* Ayato can be used in [**Vaporize (Hydro)**](../../teams/vaporize.md) teams as he applies enough **Hydro**, allowing Xiangling’s **Elemental Skill** and **Elemental Burst** to **Vaporize** while being Off-Field.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_beidou.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_fischl.png)

* Both Beidou and Fischl are used with Ayato in [**Electro-Charged (Hydro)**](../../teams/electro-charged-hydro.md) teams.
* Beidou’s **Elemental Burst** can deal large amounts of **Electro** **DMG** while Beidou is Off-Field. Ayato's **Normal Attacks** allows Beidou's **Elemental Burst** to trigger often.
* Fischl is often paired with Beidou due to Beidou's **Elemental Burst** high energy cost. Fischl generates **Energy Particles** for Beidou, provides more Off-Field **Electro DMG** and also activates **Electro Resonance**. It is also possible to use Fischl by herself for **Electro-Charged** reactions if you do not have Beidou.

* As with all **Elemental DMG** DPS characters, **Anemo** supports and Zhongli works well by reducing the enemies' **Elemental RES** with **Viridescent Venerer** 4-set or Zhongli's **Jade Shield**. **Anemo** characters often also supply useful Crowd Control abilities or other buffs.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Yunjin.png)

* Yunjin can boost Ayato's **Normal Attacks**.&#x20;

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_xingqiu.png)

* Xingqiu deals good **Hydro DMG** Off-Field and is a good Energy Battery for Ayato.

## **Does Not Work Well With**

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_ayaka.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_ganyu.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_chongyun.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_kaeya.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_rosaria.png)

* Ayato can work in **Freeze** teams by equipping 4 Blizzard Strayer and at the cost of building a lot more **Energy Recharge** than he normally would.
* Not encouraged due to better **Hydro** alternatives.
