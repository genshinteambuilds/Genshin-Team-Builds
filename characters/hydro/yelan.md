# Yelan

## Roles

* **Off-Field DPS** (Elemental Burst)
* **Burst DPS** (C6)
* **Support:** Buffer (A4, C4)

## Character Breakdown

* **Elemental Skill** significantly increases Yelan's movement speed, entangling enemies in her path with her Lifeline that explodes at the end of the skill's duration which deals **Hydro DMG**.&#x20;
* **Elemental Burst** deals **AoE Hydro DMG** and creates an Exquisite Throw that surrounds the active character and deals **Hydro DMG** when either a character performs a **Normal Attack** or when Yelan's Lifeline explodes.
  * The **Hydro DMG** dealt by Exquisite Throw scales proportionally to Yelan's **Max HP**.
* After spending 5s outside of combat, Yelan will gain the ability to fire a Breakthrough Barb using her **Charged Attack** which has 80% decreased charge time that deals **AoE Hydro DMG** based on Yelan's **Max HP**.
* **A4** allows Yelan's **Elemental Burst** to buff the active character's **DMG** by 3.5% every second up to a maximum of 50%.

## Additional Notes

* The Exquisite Throw summoned by Yelan's **Elemental Burst** can apply **Hydro** to enemies similarly to Xingqiu's Rain Swords from his **Elemental Burst.**
* The explosion from Yelan's Lifeline at the end of her **Elemental Skill** duration also applies **Hydro** on entangled enemies.
* **C2** allows Exquisite Throw to fire an additional arrow that deals 14% of Yelan's **Max HP** as **Hydro DMG** with a cooldown of 1.8s.
  * The extra instance of Hydro application from this constellation allows Yelan to effectively vaporize all of Hu Tao's **Charged Attacks** when they are paired in a team.&#x20;
* **C4** buffs all party member's **Max HP** by 10% for every enemy hit by Yelan's **Elemental Skill** up to a maximum of 40%
* **C6** will enter Yelan into a Mastermind state for 20s when she casts her **Elemental Burst**. In this state, all of Yelan's **Normal Attacks** become Special Breakthrough Barbs that deal 156% of a normal Breakthrough Barb's **DMG**. The Mastermind state will be cleared after 5s.
  * This constellation effectively allows Yelan to become a **Burst DPS** due to the high **AoE Hydro DMG** scaling of her Special Breakthrough Barbs.

## Works Well With

* Like Xingqiu, Yelan works well with almost every character in the game so long as the active character on-field uses **Normal Attacks** to trigger Yelan's Exquisite Throw from her **Elemental Burst**.
  * Even characters that may solely rely on **Charged Attacks** as their main source of **DMG** such as Bow Users may utilise Yelan's Exquisite Throw by performing a **Normal Attack** between each **Charged Attack**.
* Yelan can be interchangeable with Xingqui as a core member of many **Vaporize**, **Electro-charged**, and **Freeze** Teams.
* Yelan also has great synergy with Xingqui as they can provide large amounts of energy particles for each other and Xingqui's **C2** decreases the **Hydro RES** of enemies which greatly amplifies their **DMG** per team rotation.

## Does Not Work Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Ganyu.png)

* Ganyu's primary damage comes from using aimed **Charged Attacks**. This results in Yelan's **Elemental Burst** not triggering as **Normal Attacks** are required to trigger them.
* While **Freeze** can technically be done by weaving **Normal Attacks** between **Charged Attacks** to trigger Yelan's **Elemental Burst**, this generally results in less damage overall and is incredibly clunky to play.
