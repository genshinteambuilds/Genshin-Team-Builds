# Tartaglia

## **Roles**

* **Main DPS**
* **Burst Sub DPS**

## **Character Breakdown**

* Elemental Skill deals AoE hydro damage to surrounding enemies and switches Tartarglia into a Melee stance with dual wielding hydro blades.
* At A4, whenever Tartaglia hits a crit when using his normal or charged attacks on his melee stance, it will mark enemies hit with Riptide.
* Elemental Burst effects change depending on whether Tartaglia is in his Ranged or Melee stance.
  * When Ranged, Tartaglia's Elemental Burst deals high AoE hydro damage and applies Riptide to any enemies hit.
  * When Melee, Tartaglia's Elemental Burst deals even higher AoE hydro damage and triggers Riptide Blast on any enemies hit that are already affected by Riptide.
* Tartarglia's Charged Attacks while in Ranged stance can also deal Hydro damage and apply Riptide to enemies when fully Charged.
  * Ranged Attacks on Tartaglia are typically avoided if possible.

### Riptide

Enemies affected by Riptide can take additional damage in multiple ways.

* Riptide Flash: Using Ranged stance Aimed Shot Charged Attacks on enemies affected by Riptide will deal consecutive bouts of AoE damage.
* Riptide Burst: Defeating an enemy affected by Riptide will create an AoE Hydro burst that inflicts the Riptide status on nearby opponents hit.
* Riptide Slash: When Tartaglia hits an enemy affected by Riptide with Normal or Charged Attacks while in his Melee stance, he triggers Riptide Slash that deals AoE Hydro damage.
* Riptide Blast: Enemies hit by Tartaglias Elemental Burst while he is in his Melee stance will be cleared of their Riptide status and take AoE Hydro damage.

## Additional Notes

* A1 extends Riptide's duration on enemies by 8 seconds.
* Tartaglia's passive talent, increases your whole team's Normal Attack talent level by 1.
* C4 can cause issues with his Vaporize Oneshot team due to constantly applying Hydro on nearby enemies with Riptide Flash.

## Works Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_xiangling.png) 

* Tartaglia applies Hydro quickly in his Melee stance allowing Xiangling’s Elemental Skill and Burst to Reverse Vaporize it while being Off-Field. Check out the [Vaporize team ](../../teams/vaporize.md)page for more details.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_beidou.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_fischl.png) 

* Both Beidou and Fischl are often used with Tartaglia in his [Electro-Charged teams](../../teams/electro-charged.md).
* Beidou’s Elemental Burst can deal large amounts of electro damage while Beidou is Off-Field. Tartaglia’s fast attack speed during his melee stance can also cause Beidou's Elemental Burst to trigger more often.
* Fischl is often paired with Beidou due to Beidou's high Elemental Burst energy cost. Fischl generates more energy for Beidou, provides more Off-Field damage and also Electro Resonance. It is also possible to use Fischl by herself for Electro-Charged reactions if you do not have Beidou.

* As with all Elemental Damage DPS, Anemo supports and Zhongli works well by reducing the enemy's Elemental Resistance with Viridescent Venerer or Zhongli's Jade Shield. Anemo characters often also supply useful Crowd Control abilities or other buffs.
* Bennett basically works with everything under the sun. He provides buffing and healing and can also allow Tartaglia to Vaporize enemies in certain Oneshot team compositions.

 ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_xingqiu.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_barbara.png) 

* Not used as often but these two characters can increase Tartaglias damage at certain constellations.
* At C2, Xingqiu decreases the Hydro RES of enemies hit by his Elemental burst’s Hydro swords.
* At C2, Barbara increases Hydro DMG bonus by 15% to whoever is on field while her Elemental Skill is active.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_mona.png) 

* Typically only used with Tartaglia in Oneshot team compositions. Mona provides the Omen debuff to enemies that increases damage taken by enemies for a certain period of time. This can be used to further increase Tartaglia’s Vaporize Burst damage.

## **Does Not Work Well With**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_ayaka.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_chongyun.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_ganyu.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_kaeya.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_rosaria.png) 

* Tartaglia generally does not work well in Freeze teams due to the long cooldown on his Elemental Skill resulting in periods of time where Hydro cannot be applied on to enemies reliably except via Charged Aimed Shots.
* At C6, Tartaglia can maintain 100% uptime of his Melee stance that can make these team compositions work well.

  ****![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_eula.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_razor.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_xinyan.png) 

* Physical damage based characters do not synergize well with Tartaglia's Hydro damage.

#### [Vaporize](../../teams/vaporize.md)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_tartaglia.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_xiangling.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_sucrose.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_bennett.png) 

* Xiangling's Elemental Burst and Elemental Skill can work Off-Field allowing you to attack enemies in Tartaglia's Melee stance, inflicting the enemy with Hydro and allowing Xiangling's abilities to Reverse Vaporize for additional damage.
* This is technically a Reverse Vaporize team composition since Xiangling's abilities are typically what triggers the reaction but is included in the Vaporize team page for simplicity.
* Tartaglia can also use his Elemental Burst and deal very high amounts of AoE Vaporize damage as enemies can be easily inflicted with Pyro with Xiangling, Bennett or Anemo characters that can absorb Pyro.

#### [Electro-Charged](../../teams/electro-charged.md)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_tartaglia.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_beidou.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_fischl.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_bennett.png) 

* This exact team is often called Fireworks due to the many different coloured numbers that pop up on the screen when playing this exact team composition. Check out the Electro-Charged team page for variations on this team composition.
* Tartarglia's ability to attack rapidly while in his Melee stance allows Beidou's Elemental Burst to take effect multiple times.

#### [Oneshot](../../teams/other/oneshot.md)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_tartaglia.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_bennett.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_mona.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_sucrose.png) 

* A common Oneshot team setup for Tartaglia. For a detailed look at how Oneshots work, check out the [Oneshot ](../../teams/other/oneshot.md)team page.
