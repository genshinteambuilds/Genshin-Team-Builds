# Tartaglia

## **Roles**

* **Main DPS**
* **Burst DPS**

## **Character Breakdown**

* **Elemental Skill** deals hydro damage in an AoE around him and switches Tartarglia into a Melee stance with dual wielding hydro blades.
* **Elemental Burst** effects change depending on whether Tartaglia is in his Ranged or Melee stance.
  * When Ranged, Tartaglia's **Elemental Burst** deals high AoE **Hydro** damage and applies **Riptide** to any enemies hit.
  * When Melee, Tartaglia's **Elemental Burst** deals even higher AoE **Hydro** damage and triggers **Riptide Blast** on any enemies hit that are already affected by Riptide.
* **A4** allows Tartaglia to mark enemies hit with **Riptide** whenever he deals **Critical Damage** using his **Normal Attacks** or **Charged Attacks** in his melee stance.
* Tartarglia's **Charged Attacks** while in Ranged stance can also deal **Hydro** damage and apply **Riptide** to enemies when fully Charged.
  * Ranged Attacks on Tartaglia are typically avoided if possible.

### Riptide

Enemies affected by **Riptide** can take additional damage in multiple ways.

* Riptide Flash: Using Ranged stance **Aimed Shot** **Charged Attacks** on enemies affected by Riptide will deal consecutive bouts of AoE damage.
* Riptide Burst: Defeating an enemy affected by **Riptide** will create an AoE **Hydro** burst that inflicts the **Riptide** status on nearby opponents hit.
* Riptide Slash: When Tartaglia hits an enemy affected by **Riptide** with **Normal Attacks** or **Charged Attacks** while in his Melee stance, he triggers Riptide Slash that deals AoE **Hydro** damage.
* Riptide Blast: Enemies hit by Tartaglia's **Elemental Burst** while he is in his Melee stance will be cleared of their **Riptide** status and take AoE **Hydro** damage.

## Additional Notes

* **A1** extends Riptide's duration on enemies by 8 seconds.
* Tartaglia's Passive Talent increases your whole team's **Normal Attack** talent level by 1.
* **C4** can cause issues with his **Vaporize** Oneshot team due to constantly applying **Hydro** on nearby enemies with Riptide Flash.

## Works Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)

* Bennett's **Elemental Burst** provides healing and a massive **Attack** buff, making him a recommended character in most teams.

* Tartaglia applies **Hydro** quickly in his Melee stance allowing Xiangling’s **Elemental Skill** and **Elemental Burst** to **Vaporize** it while being Off-Field. Check out the [**Vaporize(Hydro)**](../../teams/vaporize.md) team page for more details.&#x20;

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Beidou.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Fischl.png)

* Both Beidou and Fischl are often used with Tartaglia in his [**Electro-Charged**](../../teams/electro-charged.md) **** teams**.**
* Beidou’s **Elemental Burst** can deal large amounts of **Electro** damage while Beidou is Off-Field. Tartaglia’s fast attack speed during his melee stance can also cause Beidou's **Elemental Burst** to trigger more often.
* Fischl is often paired with Beidou due to Beidou's high **Elemental Burst** energy cost. Fischl generates more energy for Beidou, provides more Off-Field damage and also **Electro Resonance**. It is also possible to use Fischl by herself for **Electro-Charged** reactions if you do not have Beidou.

* As with all **Elemental Damage** DPS characters, **Anemo** supports and Zhongli works well by reducing the enemy's **Elemental Resistance** with Viridescent Venerer or Zhongli's Jade Shield. **Anemo** characters often also supply useful Crowd Control abilities or other buffs.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Mona.png)

* Typically only used with Tartaglia in **** [**Oneshot**](../../teams/oneshot.md) team compositions. Mona provides the **Omen** debuff to enemies that increases damage taken by enemies for a certain period of time. This can be used to further increase Tartaglia’s **Vaporize** **Elemental Burst** damage.

## **Does Not Work Well With**

* Tartaglia generally does not work well in **Freeze** teams due to the long cooldown on his **Elemental Skill** resulting in periods of time where **Hydro** cannot be applied on to enemies reliably except via Charged Aimed Shots.
* At **Constellation 6**, Tartaglia can maintain 100% uptime of his Melee stance that can make these team compositions work well.

* **Physical** damage based characters do not synergize well with Tartaglia's **Hydro** damage.

* This exact team is often called Fireworks due to the many different colored numbers that pop up on the screen when playing this exact team composition. Check out the **Electro-Charged** team page for variations on this team composition.
* Tartarglia's ability to attack rapidly while in his Melee stance allows Beidou's **Elemental Burst** to take effect multiple times.

* Xiangling's **Elemental Burst** and **Elemental Skill** can work Off-Field allowing you to attack enemies in Tartaglia's Melee stance, inflicting the enemy with **Hydro** and allowing Xiangling's abilities to Reverse **Vaporize** for additional damage.
* This is technically a Reverse **Vaporize** team composition since Xiangling's abilities are typically what triggers the reaction but is included in the **Vaporize** team page for simplicity.
* Tartaglia can also use his **Elemental Burst** and deal very high amounts of AoE **Vaporize** damage as enemies can be easily inflicted with **Pyro** with Xiangling, Bennett or Anemo characters that can absorb **Pyro**.
