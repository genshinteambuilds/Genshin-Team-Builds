# Tartaglia

## **Roles**

* **Main DPS**
* **Burst DPS**

## **Character Breakdown**

* **Elemental Skill** deals hydro damage in an **AoE** around him and switches Tartarglia into a Melee stance with dual wielding hydro blades.
* **Elemental Burst** effects change depending on whether Tartaglia is in his Ranged or Melee stance.
  * When Ranged, Tartaglia's **Elemental Burst** deals high **AoE** **Hydro** **Damage** and applies Riptide to any enemies hit.
  * When Melee, Tartaglia's **Elemental Burst** deals even higher **AoE** **Hydro Damage** and triggers **** Riptide Blast on any enemies hit that are already affected by Riptide.
* **A4** allows Tartaglia to mark enemies hit with Riptide whenever he deals **Critical Damage** using his **Normal Attacks** or **Charged Attacks** in his melee stance.
* Tartarglia's **Charged Attacks** while in Ranged stance can also deal **Hydro** **Damage** and apply Riptide to enemies when fully Charged.
  * Ranged Attacks on Tartaglia are typically avoided if possible.

### Riptide

Enemies affected by Riptide can take additional damage in multiple ways.

* **Riptide Flash**: Using Ranged stance Aimed Shot **Charged Attacks** on enemies affected by Riptide will deal consecutive bouts of **AoE** **Hydro Damage**.
* **Riptide Burst**: Defeating an enemy affected by Riptide will create an **AoE** **Hydro** burst that inflicts the Riptide **** status on nearby opponents hit.
* **Riptide Slash**: When Tartaglia hits an enemy affected by Riptide with **Normal Attacks** or **Charged Attacks** while in his Melee stance, he triggers Riptide Slash that deals **AoE** **Hydro** **Damage**.
* **Riptide Blast**: Enemies hit by Tartaglia's **Elemental Burst** while he is in his Melee stance will be cleared of their Riptide **** status and take **AoE** **Hydro Damage**.

## Additional Notes

* **A1** extends Riptide's duration on enemies by 8 seconds.
* Tartaglia's Passive Talent increases the **Normal Attack** Talent level by 1 on all party members.
* **C4** can cause issues with his [**Oneshot**](../../teams/oneshot.md) team due to constantly applying **Hydro** on nearby enemies with **Riptide Flash**.

## Works Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)

* Bennett's **Elemental Burst** provides healing and a massive **Attack** buff, making him a recommended character in most teams.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xiangling.png)

* Tartaglia is often used in [**Vaporize (Hydro)**](../../teams/vaporize.md) teams as he applies **Hydro** quickly in his Melee stance allowing Xiangling’s **Elemental Skill** and **Elemental Burst** to **Vaporize** while being Off-Field.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Beidou.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Fischl.png)

* Both Beidou and Fischl are often used with Tartaglia in [**Electro-Charged (Hydro)**](../../teams/electro-charged-hydro.md) **** teams**.**
* Beidou’s **Elemental Burst** can deal large amounts of **Electro** **Damage** while Beidou is Off-Field. Tartaglia’s fast **Attack Speed** during his melee stance can also cause Beidou's **Elemental Burst** to trigger more often.
* Fischl is often paired with Beidou due to Beidou's **Elemental Burst** high energy cost. Fischl generates **Energy Particles** for Beidou, provides more Off-Field damage and also activates **Electro Resonance**. It is also possible to use Fischl by herself for **Electro-Charged** reactions if you do not have Beidou.

* As with all **Elemental Damage** DPS characters, **Anemo** supports and Zhongli works well by reducing the enemies' **Elemental Resistance** with **Viridescent Venerer** 4-set or Zhongli's **Jade Shield**. **Anemo** characters often also supply useful Crowd Control abilities or other Buffs.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Mona.png)

* Typically only used with Tartaglia in **** [**Oneshot**](../../teams/oneshot.md) teams. Mona provides the **Omen** Debuff to enemies which increases damage taken for a certain period of time.

## **Does Not Work Well With**

* Tartaglia generally does not work well in **Freeze** teams due to the long Cooldown on his **Elemental Skill** resulting in periods of time where **Hydro** cannot be applied on to enemies reliably except via **Charged Attack** Aimed Shots.
* At **C6**, Tartaglia can maintain 100% uptime of his Melee stance that can make these team compositions work well.

* **Physical** damage based characters do not synergize well with Tartaglia's **Hydro** **Damage**.

#### [Electro-Charged (Hydro)](../../teams/electro-charged-hydro.md)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Tartaglia.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Beidou.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Fischl.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)

* This exact team is often called Fireworks due to the many different colored numbers that pop up on the screen when playing this exact team composition.
* Tartarglia's ability to attack rapidly while in his Melee stance allows Beidou's **Elemental Burst** to trigger more often.

#### [Oneshot](../../teams/oneshot.md)

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Tartaglia.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Mona.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Sucrose.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)

* Tartaglia's main focus is to Oneshot enemies with his **Elemental Burst**. For a detailed look at how this team works, check out the [**Oneshot**](../../teams/oneshot.md) page.
* Bennett provides an **Attack** Buff and applies **Pyro** on enemies for the **Vaporize** reaction.
* Mona can apply the **Omen** Debuff to increase the damage enemies take.
* Sucrose buffs Tartaglia's **Elemental Mastery** and debuffs **Hydro Resistance** when equipped with **Viridescent Venerer** 4-set.

#### [Vaporize (Hydro)](../../teams/vaporize.md)

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Tartaglia.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xiangling.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Sucrose.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)

* Xiangling's **Elemental Burst** and **Elemental Skill** can work Off-Field allowing you to attack enemies in Tartaglia's Melee stance, inflicting the enemy with **Hydro** and allowing Xiangling's abilities to **Vaporize** for additional damage.
* Tartaglia can also use his **Elemental Burst** and deal very high amounts of **AoE Vaporize** damage as enemies can be easily inflicted with **Pyro** with Xiangling, Bennett or Anemo characters that create **Swirl** reactions with **Pyro**.
