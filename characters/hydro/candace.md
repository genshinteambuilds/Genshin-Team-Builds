## Does not Works Well With

Characters that do not benefit from the buff to the **Elemental DMG** of normal attacks.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_icon\_geo.webp)

**Geo** does not have good Reactions with **Hydro**.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_icon\_dendro.webp)

Candace does not have a skill that Generate many consecutive **Hydro** applications, therefore she is not useful for **Bloom** Reactions.

## Teams

Candace buffs the **Elemental DMG** of Yoimiya's normal attacks. Paired with Xingqiu, they provide **Hydro Resonance**. Yoimiya can make use of the Hydro Application provided by the two to deal high damage **Vaporize** reactions.

Another team that benefits from use Double Hydro to increase the **Elemental DMG** buff that Candace brings to Ayatoâ€™s normal attacks. Venti reduces **Hydro Res** of the enemies with **VV** set.
