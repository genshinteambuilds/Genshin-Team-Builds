## Works Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_icon\_hydro.webp)

* All the damage that Candace can do is based on her **Max HP.** As such, taking advantage of **Hydro Resonance** to obtain a 25% **Max HP** bonus is essential.

* Characters that rely on their **Normal Attacks** to deal **Elemental DMG** will pair well with Candace.

## Does not Work Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_icon\_geo.webp)

**Geo** does not have good reactions with **Hydro**.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_icon\_dendro.webp)

Candace does not have a skill that applies **Hydro** very frequently and as such is not ideal for causing **Bloom.**

## Teams

Candace buffs the **Elemental DMG** of Yoimiya's **Normal Attacks** and activates **Hydro Resonance along with** Xingqiu. Yoimiya can make use of the **Hydro** provided by the two to deal high damage **Vaporize** reactions.

Candace can both buff the damage of Ayato's **Normal Attacks** as well as activate **Hydro Resonance** with him.
