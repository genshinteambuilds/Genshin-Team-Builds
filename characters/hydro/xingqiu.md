# Xingqiu

## **Roles**

* **Off-Field DPS**
* **Support:** Cleanser \(Self Only\), Debuffer \(At C2\)

## **Character Breakdown**

* Elemental Skill \(Guhua Sword: Fatal Rainscreen\) does 2 instances of hydro damage. It also applies wet status to Xingqiu for a brief moment after doing both of the slashes. After the animation of the hydro slashes, 3 to 4 rain swords will circle the active character. Those rain swords make the characters take less damage and are immune to knockbacks.
* Elemental Burst \(Guhua Sword: Raincutter\) has the same effect as his Elemental Skill and it will trigger Rainbow Bladework that summons Hydro Swords and attacks the enemies hit by the active character’s Normal Attacks.

## **Additional Notes**

* With his 1st Ascension talent, Hydropathic, when his rain swords is shattered, the active character will regenerate HP based on Xingqiu’s Max HP. The number of times the active character heals whenever his rain swords is shattered depends on his Constellation.
* His 4th Ascension talent, Blades Amidst Raindrops, Xingqiu gains 20% Hydro Bonus Damage
* His passive talent, Flash of Genius, when Xingqiu crafts character talent materials, he has a 25% chance to refund a portion of the crafting materials used.
* C1 increases the maximum number of Rain Swords by 1
* C2 extends the duration of Xingqiu’s Elemental Burst by 3 seconds and on top of that, Xingqiu also decreases the Hydro RES of enemies hit by his Rain Swords by 15% for 4 seconds
* Both his Elemental Skill and Burst can deal significant damage when properly built.
* Xingqiu’s Elemental Skill makes him have wet status, thus cleansing aura on HIMSELF ONLY.

## **Works Well With**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/element_anemo.webp) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/element_cryo.webp) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/element_electro.webp) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/element_hydro.webp) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/element_pyro.webp) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/element_geo.webp) 

* Xingqiu works really well with most characters with these elements. Xingqiu is a core member of most vaporize, electro-charged, and freeze compositions and he works really well with sword, claymore, and polearm users.
* Anemo characters can hold 4 Viridescent Venerer that shred enemies Hydro RES when hydro is swirled.
* Xingqiu works well with another hydro if he’s C2. Check additional notes for more info.

## **Does Not Work Well With**

\*\*\*\*![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_ganyu.png) ****

* Ganyu only wants to permanently use her Aimed Charged Attacks to deal damage, leaving Xingqiu’s Elemental Burst underutilized since it only gets triggered when the active character on the field uses a Normal Attack. If you want to run Freeze Ganyu with Xingqiu, you would need to weave Normal Attacks to trigger Xingqiu’s Elemental Burst.
