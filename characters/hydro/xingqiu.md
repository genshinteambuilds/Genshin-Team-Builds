# Xingqiu

## **Roles**

* **Off-Field DPS** (Elemental Burst)
* **Support:** Debuffer (C2), Cleanser (Self Only), Healer (Limited Capability)

## **Character Breakdown**

* Elemental Skill deals **Hydro DMG** and applies **Hydro** to Xingqiu momentarily. Xingqiu's **Elemental Skill** also surrounds the active character with Rain Swords which reduce incoming damage and improves the active character's interruption resistance.
* **Elemental Burst** is identical to **Elemental Skill** in applying the **Hydro** to Xingqiu momentarily and surrounding the active character with Rain Swords. These Rain swords will summon **Hydro** sword rain attacks that attack any enemies when a character performs a **Normal Attack**.
* **A1** allows Xingqiu's Rain Swords from his **Elemental Skill** and **Burst** to heal the active character based on Xingqiu's **Max** **HP** when it expires or breaks.

## **Additional Notes**

* The Rain Swords summoned by Xingqiu's **Elemental Skill** and **Elemental Burst** can apply **Hydro** to enemies just by touching the enemy similar to Barbara's **Elemental Skill**.
* **C2** extends the duration of Xingqiu’s **Elemental Burst** by 3 seconds and decreases the **Hydro** **RES** of enemies hit by his sword rain attacks by 15% for 4 seconds.
* **C4** provides a massive increase in his **Elemental Skill DMG** if cast while his **Elemental Burst** is active.
* Xingqiu's **Elemental Skill** and **Elemental Burst** apply **Hydro** momentarily to himself, allowing him to cleanse Debuffs on himself but not other members of the team. This can also cause Xingqiu to become momentarily **Frozen** if Xingqiu is affected by **Cryo** before using his **Elemental Skill** or **Elemental Burst**.

## **Works Well With**

* Xingqiu works incredibly well with almost every character in the game so long as the Main DPS character being used uses **Normal Attacks** that can trigger Xingqiu's **Elemental Burst** sword rain attacks.
  * Even **Charged Attack** based characters besides those that use Bows can make use of Xingqiu as a single **Normal Attack** is performed before each **Charged Attack**.
* Xingqiu is a core member of many **Vaporize**, **Electro-charged**, and **Freeze** teams.
* Xingqiu also works with other **Hydro** characters at **C2** as his sword rain attacks decrease the **Hydro** **RES** of enemies.

## **Does Not Work Well With**

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_ganyu.png)

* Ganyu's primary damage comes from using aimed **Charged Attacks**. This results in Xingqiu's **Elemental Burst** not triggering as **Normal Attacks** are required to trigger them.
* While **Freeze** can technically be done by weaving **Normal Attacks** between **Charged Attacks** to trigger Xingqiu's **Elemental Burst**, this is generally results in less damage overall and incredibly clunky to play.

## **Teams**

{% endhint %}

#### [**Electro-Charged (Electro)**](../../teams/electro-charged.md)

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_keqing.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_xingqiu.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_beidou.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_kazuha.png)

* Xingqiu is often used as the premier **Hydro** Off-Field DPS character in **Electro-Charged** teams to apply **Hydro** on enemies.
* Xingqui's **Hydro** application is based on **Normal Attacks**, so an On-Field character who uses them is necessary to constantly trigger the reaction.

#### [Freeze](../../teams/freeze.md)

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_ayaka.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_xingqiu.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_kazuha.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_diona.png)

* Xingqiu is often used as the **Hydro** Off-Field DPS character in **Freeze** teams and apply **Hydro** to enemies and keep them permanently **Frozen**.

#### [National](../../teams/national.md)

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_xiangling.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_xingqiu.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_sucrose.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_bennett.png)

* A popular team based around quickly swapping between characters and cycling their powerful **Elemental Bursts**, Xingqiu is used here primarily to provide **Vaporize** reactions with Xiangling's **Elemental Burst** and can also **Freeze** enemies when used with Chongyun, allowing **Pyro** attacks to **Melt** instead.

#### [Physical (Cryo)](../../teams/physical-cryo.md)

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_eula.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_fischl.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_xingqiu.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_diona.png)​​

* While Xingqiu does not contribute to the **Superconduct** reaction required for **Physical** teams at all, he is in general just an incredibly useful support; incidentally **Freezing** enemies, dealing large amounts of damage by himself, providing Damage Reduction, and increasing resistance to interruption.

#### [Vaporize (Pyro)](../../teams/reverse-vaporize.md)

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_hutao.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_xingqiu.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_sucrose.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_diona.png)

* Xingqiu is the Core Support / Off-Field DPS required to make **Vaporize** teams work. His **Elemental Burst** deals a large amount of **Hydro DMG** and consistently applies **Hydro** to enemies to allow the **Pyro** Main DPS character to consistently trigger **Vaporize** reactions.
