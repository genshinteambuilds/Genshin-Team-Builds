# Xingqiu

## **Roles**

* **Off-Field DPS** (Elemental Burst)
* **Support:** Debuffer (Constellation 2), Cleanser (Self Only), Healer (Limited Capability)

## **Character Breakdown**

* Elemental Skill deals hydro damage and applies the Wet Status to Xingqiu momentarily. Xingqiu's Elemental skill also surrounds the active character with 3 (4 if Constellation 1) rain swords which reduce incoming damage and improves the active character's Interruption Resistance.
* Elemental Burst is identical to Elemental Skill in applying the Wet Status to Xingqiu momentarily and surrounding the active character with rain swords. These rain swords will summon Hydro sword rain attacks that attack any enemies hit by the active character's Normal Attacks.
* At Ascension 1, when Xingqiu's rain swords from his Elemental Skill shatter, the active character regenerates HP based on Xingqiu's Max HP. Rain swords generated by Xingqiu's Elemental Burst cannot shatter.

## **Additional Notes**

* The rain swords summoned by Xingqiu's Elemental Skill and Burst can apply Hydro to enemies just by touching the enemy similar to Barbara's Elemental Skill.
* Constellation 2 extends the duration of Xingqiu’s Elemental Burst by 3 seconds and decreases the Hydro Resistance of enemies hit by his Hydro sword rain attacks by 15% for 4 seconds.
* Constellation 4 provides a massive increase in Elemental Skill damage if used when his Elemental Burst is active.
* Xingqiu's Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst apply the Wet Status momentarily to himself, allowing him to cleanse himself but not other members of the team. This can also cause Xingqiu to become momentarily frozen if Xingqiu is affected by Cryo before using his Elemental Skill or Burst.

## **Works Well With**

* Xingqiu works incredibly well with almost every character in the game so long as the Main DPS character being used uses Normal Attacks that can trigger Xingqiu's Elemental Burst's Hydro rain sword attacks.
  * Even Charged Attack based characters besides those that use Bows can make use of Xingqiu as a single Normal Attack is performed before each Charged Attack.
* Xingqiu is a core member of most Vaporize, Electro-charged, and Freeze team compositions.
* Xingqiu also works with other Hydro characters at Constellation 2 as his Hydro rain sword attacks decrease the Hydro Resistance of enemies.

## **Does Not Work Well With**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Ganyu.png)

* Ganyu's primary damage comes from using aimed Charged Attacks. This results in Xingqiu's Elemental Burst not attacking the enemy with Hydro rain sword attacks as Normal Attacks are required to trigger them.
* While Freeze can technically be done by weaving Normal Attacks between Charged Attacks to trigger Xingqiu's Hydro rain sword attacks, this is generally a DPS loss and incredibly clunky to play.

## **Teams**

#### [Reverse Vaporize](../../teams/reverse-vaporize.md)

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Hutao.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Sucrose.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Diona.png)

* Xingqiu is the Core Support / Sub DPS required to build Reverse Vaporize team compositions. His Elemental Burst deals a large amount of damage and applies Hydro to enemies to allow the Pyro Main DPS character to complete Reverse Vaporize reactions.

#### [Electro-Charged](../../teams/electro-charged.md)

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Keqing.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Beidou.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Kazuha.png)

* Xingqiu is often used as the premier Hydro Sub DPS character in Electro-Charged team compositions to apply Hydro to enemies.
* Xingqui's Hydro application is based on Normal Attacks, so an On-Field character who uses them is necessary to constantly trigger the reaction.

#### [Freeze](../../teams/freeze.md)

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Kaeya.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Kazuha.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Diona.png)

* Xingqiu is often used as the Hydro Sub DPS character in Freeze teams to apply Hydro to enemies and keep them permanently Frozen.

#### [Physical](../../teams/physical.md)

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Eula.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Fischl.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Diona.png)​​

* While Xingqiu does not contribute to the Superconduct reaction required for Physical teams at all, he is in general just an incredibly useful support; incidentally Freezing enemies, dealing large amounts of damage by himself, reducing damage, and increasing Interruption Resistance in a Freeze team.

#### [National](../../teams/national.md)

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xiangling.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Chongyun.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)

* A popular team based around quickly swapping between characters and cycling their powerful Elemental Bursts, Xingqiu is used here primarily to provide Vaporize reactions with Xiangling's Elemental Burst and can also Freeze enemies when used with Chongyun, allowing Pyro Attacks to Melt instead.
