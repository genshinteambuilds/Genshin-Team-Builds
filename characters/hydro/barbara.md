# Barbara

## Roles:

* Support

## Character Breakdown

* AA: Applies hydro to the enemies which can be used for enabler Barbara
* Elemental Skill: Heals the one on-field every few seconds and applies hydro to the enemies on a small area around the character
* Elemental Burst: Heals everyone that is at the party

## Additional Notes

* Barbara usually needs Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayer \(TTDS\) to buff the main DPS as she doesnâ€™t offer much utility
* Her skill applies Hydro not only to the enemies but also to yourself so it can cleanse pyro but also can get you frozen
