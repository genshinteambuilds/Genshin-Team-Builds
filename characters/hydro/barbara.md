# Barbara

## Roles:

* **Support:** Healer

## Character Breakdown

* Auto Attack: Applies hydro to the enemies which can be used for enabler Barbara
* Elemental Skill: Heals and applies hydro to the active character every few seconds and applies hydro to the enemies on a small area around the character. 
* Elemental Burst: Heals all party members.

## Additional Notes

* Barbara usually runs Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayer \(TTDS\) to buff the main DPS as she doesnâ€™t offer much utility. She also benefits from the HP substat of the weapon increasing her healing.
* Her hydro application to the active character whenever the heal applies allows for the removal of enemy elemental debuffs by reacting them away. Note that this self-application also allows enemy hits to react with it resulting in the active character either taking additional damage, or being inconvenienced in another way \(freeze and electro-charged\).
