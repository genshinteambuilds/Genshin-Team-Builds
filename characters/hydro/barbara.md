# Barbara

## Roles

* **Support:** Healer

## Character Breakdown

* Auto Attack: Applies hydro to the enemies which can be used for enabler Barbara
* Elemental Skill: Heals and applies hydro to the active character every few seconds and applies hydro to the enemies on a small area around the character. 
* Elemental Burst: Heals all party members.

## Additional Notes

* Barbara usually equips Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayer to buff the main damage dealer of the team. She also benefits from the HP substat of the weapon increasing her healing.
* Her hydro application to the active character whenever the heal applies allows for the removal of enemy elemental debuffs by reacting them away. Note that this self-application also allows enemy hits to react with it resulting in the active character either taking additional damage, or being inconvenienced in another way \(Freeze and Electro-charged\).

* She can function as a healer for most teams.

## When to avoid

* Using Barbara as a healer in situations with high amounts of Pyro, Cryo, or Electro damage from enemies can be catastrophic as her Elemental Skill's hydro application to the active character can cause them to be effected by their corresponding reactions. \(Vaporize: causing the active character to take 1.5x damage from the hit, Freeze: locking the active character in place preventing dodging, and Electro-charged: applying a damage over time that staggers the active character whenever damage is applied\)

* Only recommended if the other team needs Xingqiu more and you have no Mona



## Footnotes

It is technically possible to run Barbara to apply hydro for Electro-charged based teams, or as a main dps on a vaporize team. While possible, these are very niche, tend to be worse than other teams, and not recommended.
