# Barbara

## Roles

* **Support**: Healer, Cleanser
* **Main DPS** (Not Recommended)

## Character Breakdown

* **Normal Attack** applies **Hydro** to enemies hit. **Charged Attack** applies **Hydro** in a larger **AoE**.
* **Elemental Skill** creates an aura which heals and applies **Hydro** to the active character every few seconds while also applying **Hydro** to enemies nearby the active character.
* **Elemental Skill** additionally causes Barbara's **Normal Attacks** and **Charged Attacks** to heal the party.
* **Elemental Burst** heals all party members by a large amount.
* **A1** reduces **Stamina** consumption of the active character while Barbara's **Elemental Skill** is active.
* **A4** increases the duration of Barbara's **Elemental Skill** when **Energy Particles** are picked up.

## Additional Notes

* **Elemental Skill** and **Burst** both heal based of off Barbara's **Max HP.**
* **C2** provides a 15% **Hydro DMG Bonus** while Barbara's **Elemental Skill** is active.
* **C6** resurrects a fallen party member with full health once every 15 minutes.
  * This Cooldown does not reset while entering or restarting domains, including Spiral Abyss. The resurrection can be used multiple times in multiple floors of Spiral Abyss, as long as the Cooldown is waited out.

* While Barbara is not the usual first choice for **Hydro** application for **Freeze** teams, her constant application with her **Elemental Skill** does allow her to function as a **Hydro** applier and Healer in them.

* Barbara can work in almost any team in the game as a universal Healer.
* Barbara's high healing and unique resurrection at **C6** can provide options for teams struggling to survive.

## Does not work well with

* Barbara's focus on healing while providing little else greatly reduces her synergy with other Healers and Shielders, who often fill the same role, reducing Barbara's utility.

* Barbara is acting as a budget replacement for Kokomi in this team. This is generally not recommended as Barbara's DPS is quite poor.

[**Freeze**](../../teams/freeze.md)

* Barbara can somewhat be used as a **Hydro** applicator for a **Freeze** team while also providing healing utility.
* As Barbara's DPS and **Hydro** application potential is limited compared to other characters such as Xingqui and Mona, Barbara should typically only be used if other **Hydro** applicators are being used in other teams or if healing is needed and no other characters can be swapped out.
