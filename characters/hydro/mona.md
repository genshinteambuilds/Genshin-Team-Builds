# Mona

## **Roles**

* **Burst DPS**
* **Support**: Crowd Control (Taunting, Immobilization), Debuffer

## **Character Breakdown**

* **Elemental Skill** summons a taunt that deals multiple instances of **Hydro** damage in an area around it, making it strong in **Freeze** comps.
* **Elemental Burst** applies Illusory Bubble to all enemies in an area around her which applies **Hydro**, immobilizes enemies and provides the Omen debuff which increases all damage enemies take.
  * When enemies take damage, the Illusory Bubble deals a large amount of **Hydro** damage. The Omen debuff will persist for 4 seconds after this.

## **Additional Notes**

* Mona most often is used to increase her team's damage via her **Elemental Burst**'s debuff, but can also be used as a Burst Sub Dps.
* Mona’s **Elemental Burst** damage is affected by its own Damage Bonus buff.
* Mona’s **Elemental Burst** will suspend smaller targets, effectively stunning them in place throughout its duration but will not suspend larger targets at all.
* Mona can be built for her **Elemental Burst**'s Damage but should only be done so in teams that can amplify this damage, like **Vaporize**. If in a team that cannot, like **Freeze**, it is recommended to build her more for Support.
* **Ascension 1** will create a weaker copy of Mona's **Elemental Skill** when Mona spends 2 seconds sprinting lasting 2 seconds and dealing less damage.
* **Ascension 4** buffs Mona's **Hydro Damage** by 20% of her current Energy Recharge.
* **Constellation 1** gives Omen an extra effect.
  * Increases the Damage of all Elemental Reactions that require Hydro by 15%.
  * Increases the duration of the** Freeze** Reaction by 15%

## **Works Well With**

* Bennett both allows Mona's **Elemental Burst** to be **Vaporized** and grants an **Attack** buff to her, letting her become a Burst Sub Dps.

* Mona's **Elemental Skill** can keep opponents **Frozen** while her **Elemental Burst** can increase the damage of Ayaka’s **Elemental Burst**.

* Similarly to Ayaka, Mona can easily keep enemies **Frozen** and increase Ganyu's damage in **Freeze** Ganyu comps.

[![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Hutao.png)](https://genshinteambuilds.gitbook.io/teams/characters/pyro/hu-tao)

* Hu Tao provides an **Elemental Burst** with a high amount of **Pyro** damage, which can be greatly amplified by Mona's **Elemental Burst**.
* Mona’s Taunt can also serve as a decent Hydro applier for Hu Tao’s charge attacks albeit with a short duration.

## **Does Not Work Well With**

[![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Eula.png)](https://genshinteambuilds.gitbook.io/teams/characters/cryo/eula) ​​​

* Despite being a **Cryo** Character, Eula's attacks consistently cause **Shatter**, which prevents **Freeze** teams from functioning. Mona’s Damage Bonus buff from her **Elemental Burst** does not last long enough for Eula to perform the full duration of her own **Elemental Burst**.

## **Teams**

****[**Freeze**](../../teams/freeze.md)****

* Mona acts as a reliable source of **Hydro** application, allowing for enemies to have **Frozen** applied to them constantly.
* Her **Elemental Burst** acts as a way to amplify Ayaka's **Elemental Burst**'s damage.
  * Her **Elemental Burst**'s debuff can be extended against **Frozen** enemies, allowing for Ayaka to do additional damage during this duration.

****[**Vaporize(Pyro)**](../../teams/reverse-vaporize.md)****

* Mona's **Elemental Burst** debuff provides a Damage Bonus increase against enemies affected by it. She also provides taunting utility through her **Elemental Skill** and Passive Talent.
