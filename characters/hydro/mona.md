# Mona

## **Roles**

* **Burst DPS**
* **Support**: Crowd Control (Taunting, Immobilization), Buffer

## **Character Breakdown**

* Mona most often functions as a Damage Bonus buffer for her team through her Elemental Burst, but can also be used as a Burst Sub DPS.
* Elemental Skill summons a taunt that deals multiple instances of AoE Hydro damage, making it strong in Freeze comps.
* Elemental Burst applies Hydro to all enemies in an AoE, immobilizes and provides a large Damage Bonus buff against all enemies hit by it, and deals a large amount of Hydro Damage.

## **Additional Notes**

* Mona’s Elemental Burst damage is affected by its own Damage Bonus buff.
* Mona’s Elemental Burst will suspend smaller targets, effectively stunning them in place throughout its duration but will not suspend larger targets at all.
* Mona can be built for her Elemental Burst's Damage but should only be done so in teams that can amplify this damage, like Vaporize. If in a team that cannot, like Freeze, it is recommended to build her more for Support.

## **Works Well With**

* Bennett both allows Mona's Elemental Burst to be Vaporized and grants an ATK buff to her, letting her become a Burst Sub DPS.

* Mona's Elemental Skill can keep opponents Frozen while her Elemental Burst can increase the damage of Ayaka’s Elemental Burst.

* Another strong double Elemental Burst combo that can lead to extremely large damage nukes.
* Mona’s Taunt can also serve as a decent Hydro applier for Hu Tao’s charge attacks albeit with a short duration.

* Similarly to Ayaka, Mona can easily keep enemies Frozen and increase Ganyu's damage in Freeze Ganyu comps.

## **Does Not Work Well With**

[![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Eula.png)](https://genshinteambuilds.gitbook.io/teams/characters/cryo/eula) ​​​

* Despite being a Cryo Character, Eula's Attacks consistently cause Shatter, which prevents Freeze teams from functioning. Mona’s Damage Bonus buff from her Elemental Burst does not last long enough for Eula to perform the full duration of her own Elemental Burst.
