# Mona

## **Roles**

* **Burst DPS**
* **Support**: Crowd Control (Taunting, Immobilization), Debuffer
* **Main DPS**

## **Character Breakdown**

* **Elemental Skill** summons a taunt that deals multiple instances of **Hydro** **DMG** in an **AoE** around it.
* **Elemental Burst** applies Illusory Bubble to all enemies in an **AoE** around her which applies **Hydro**, immobilizes enemies and provides the **Omen** debuff which increases all **DMG** enemies take.
  * When enemies affected by the Illusory Bubble take **DMG**, the Illusory Bubble deals a large amount of **Hydro** **DMG**. The **Omen** debuff will persist for 4 seconds after this.
* **A1** creates a weaker copy of Mona's **Elemental Skill** if Mona spends at least 2 seconds sprinting.
* **A4** buffs Mona's **Hydro DMG** by 20% of her current **Energy Recharge**.

## **Additional Notes**

* Mona most often is used to boost her team's **DMG** via her **Omen** debuff, but can also be used as a Burst DPS.
* Mona’s **Elemental Burst** **DMG** is affected by **Omen**.
* Mona’s **Elemental Burst** will suspend smaller targets, effectively stunning them in place throughout its duration but will not suspend larger targets at all.
* **C1** gives **Omen** an extra effect.
  * Increases the **DMG** of all **Elemental Reactions** that require **Hydro** by 15%.
  * Increases the duration of the **Frozen** Reaction by 15%
* **Omen's** duration can be artificially increased as Mona's Illusory Bubble cannot be popped while enemies are **Frozen**. This makes her one of the best characters for [Freeze](../../teams/freeze.md) Teams.

## **Works Well With**

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_bennett.png)

* Bennett both allows Mona's **Elemental Burst** to be **Vaporized** and provides an **ATK** buff for Mona, letting her become a Burst DPS.

* Mona's **Elemental Skill** can keep opponents **Frozen** while her **Elemental Burst** can increase their **Cryo** **DMG**.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_hutao.png)

* Hu Tao provides an **Elemental Burst** with that deals a high amount of **Pyro** **DMG**, which can be greatly amplified by Mona's **Elemental Burst**.
* Mona’s **Elemental Skill** can also serve as a decent **Hydro** applier for Hu Tao’s **Charged Attacks** albeit with a short duration.

## **Does Not Work Well With**

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_eula.png)

* Despite being a **Cryo** character, Eula's attacks consistently cause **Shatter**, which prevents **Freeze** teams from functioning. Mona’s **Omen** debuff from her **Elemental Burst** does not last long enough for Eula to perform the full duration of her own **Elemental Burst**.

## **Teams**

[**Freeze (Cryo)**](../../teams/freeze.md)

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_ayaka.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_mona.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_kazuha.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_diona.png)

* Mona acts as a reliable source of **Hydro** application, allowing for enemies to have **Frozen** applied to them constantly.
* Mona's **Elemental Burst** acts as a way to amplify Ayaka's **Elemental Burst DMG** and the duration of Mona's **Elemental Burst's** Omen debuff can be extended against **Frozen** enemies.

[**Vaporize (Pyro)**](../../teams/reverse-vaporize.md)

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_hutao.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_mona.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_xingqiu.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_diona.png)

* Mona's **Omen** debuff provides a **DMG Bonus** increase against enemies affected by it. She also provides taunting utility through her **Elemental Skill** and **A1**.
