# Mona

## **Roles**

* **Burst DPS**
* **Support**: Crowd Control (Taunting, Immobilization), Debuffer
* **Main DPS** (Not Recommended)

## **Character Breakdown**

* **Elemental Skill** summons a taunt that deals multiple instances of **Hydro** **Damage** in an **AoE** around it.
* **Elemental Burst** applies **Illusory Bubble** to all enemies in an **AoE** around her which applies **Hydro**, immobilizes enemies and provides the **Omen** Debuff which increases all damage enemies take.
  * When enemies take damage, the **Illusory Bubble** deals a large amount of **Hydro** **Damage**. The **Omen** Debuff will persist for 4 seconds after this.
* **A1** will create a weaker copy of Mona's **Elemental Skill** when Mona spends 2 seconds sprinting lasting 2 seconds and dealing less damage.
* **A4** buffs Mona's **Hydro Damage** by 20% of her current **Energy Recharge**.

## **Additional Notes**

* Mona most often is used to increase her team's damage via her **Omen** Debuff, but can also be used as a Burst Sub DPS.
* Mona’s **Elemental Burst** damage is affected by **Omen**.
* Mona’s **Elemental Burst** will suspend smaller targets, effectively stunning them in place throughout its duration but will not suspend larger targets at all.
* Mona can be built for her **Elemental Burst** damage but should only be done so in teams that can amplify this damage, like [**Vaporize (Hydro)**](../../teams/vaporize.md). If in a team that cannot do so, like [**Freeze (Cryo)**](../../teams/freeze.md), it is recommended to build her more for Support.
* **C1** gives **Omen** an extra effect.
  * Increases the Damage of all **Elemental Reactions** that require **Hydro** by 15%.
  * Increases the duration of the **Frozen** Reaction by 15%
* **Omen's** duration can be artificially increased as Mona's **Illusory Bubble** cannot be popped while enemies are **Frozen**. This makes her one of the best characters for [**Freeze**](../../teams/freeze.md) Teams.

## **Works Well With**

* Bennett both allows Mona's **Elemental Burst** to be **Vaporized** and provides an **Attack** buff for Mona, letting her become a Burst Sub DPS.

* Mona's **Elemental Skill** can keep opponents **Frozen** while her **Elemental Burst** can increase their **Cryo** **Damage**.

[![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Hutao.png)](https://genshinteambuilds.gitbook.io/teams/characters/pyro/hu-tao)

* Hu Tao provides an **Elemental Burst** with that deals a high amount of **Pyro** **Damage**, which can be greatly amplified by Mona's **Elemental Burst**.
* Mona’s **Elemental Skill** can also serve as a decent **Hydro** applier for Hu Tao’s **Charge Attacks** albeit with a short duration.

## **Does Not Work Well With**

[![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Eula.png)](https://genshinteambuilds.gitbook.io/teams/characters/cryo/eula) ​​​

* Despite being a **Cryo** character, Eula's attacks consistently cause **Shatter**, which prevents **Freeze** teams from functioning. Mona’s **Omen D**ebuff from her **Elemental Burst** does not last long enough for Eula to perform the full duration of her own **Elemental Burst**.

## **Teams**

****[**Freeze (Cryo)**](../../teams/freeze.md)****

****![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Ayaka.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Mona.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Diona.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Kazuha.png)

* Mona acts as a reliable source of **Hydro** application, allowing for enemies to have **Frozen** applied to them constantly.
* Her **Elemental Burst** acts as a way to amplify Ayaka's **Elemental Burst's** damage.
  * Her **Elemental Burst's** Debuff can be extended against **Frozen** enemies, allowing for Ayaka to do additional damage during this duration.

****[**Vaporize (Pyro)**](../../teams/reverse-vaporize.md)****

[![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Hutao.png) ​](https://genshinteambuilds.gitbook.io/teams/characters/hydro/mona)[![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Mona.png)](https://genshinteambuilds.gitbook.io/teams/characters/pyro/bennett) [![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)](https://genshinteambuilds.gitbook.io/teams/characters/anemo/kazuha) [![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Diona.png)](https://genshinteambuilds.gitbook.io/teams/characters/pyro/hu-tao)​

* Mona's **Omen** Debuff provides a damage bonus increase against enemies affected by it. She also provides taunting utility through her **Elemental Skill** and **A1**.
