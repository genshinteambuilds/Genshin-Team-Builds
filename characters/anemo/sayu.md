# Sayu

## Roles

* Support \(Debuff, Healer\)

## Character Breakdown

* Sayu functions as an anemo healer, primarily used for her burst, which provides healing to active characters.
* She is also an Anemo character and thus is able to carry Viridescent Venerer allowing her to shred resistances.

## Additional Notes

* Her skill acts as a no-stamina cost sprint when held that also gives her slight stagger resistance. But, should you choose to do this, the cooldown is increased depending on how long you spend rolling. Good for exploration, very niche in combat.
* Her first constellation makes healing with her much more consistent, while her fourth constellation helps with maintaining energy to maximize her burst uptime.
* Her sixth constellation makes elemental mastery on her much more important, as it increases her scaling with elemental mastery significantly.

* Sayu works fairly well with most elemental teams, as 4 set Viridescent Venerer is always welcome, and combining it with a healer allows for other supports to fit on the team.

## Does Not Work Well With

* Sayu does not provide much benefit over other healers on a Physical or Geo focused team, as she cannot decrease Physical or Geo resistance.
