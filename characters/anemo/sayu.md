# Sayu

## Roles

* **Support**: Healer, Debuffer (VV)
* **Off-Field DPS** (Elemental Burst)

## Character Breakdown

* **Elemental Skill (Tap)** makes Sayu roll forward a short distance and then deal **Anemo** Damage to enemies in front of her.
* **Elemental Skill (Hold)** makes Sayu roll forwards continuously, increasing her resistance to interruption and dealing **Anemo **damage while rolling. Using the skill again will cause Sayu to end her roll early and deal additional **Anemo** damage to enemies in front of her.
  * **Elemental Skill (Hold)** can absorb another element, dealing additional damage of that element to enemies hit while Sayu is rolling.
* **Elemental Skill** cooldown time creases depending on how long Sayu spends rolling.
* **Elemental Burst** summons a **Daruma** that deals **Anemo** damage to nearby enemies and heals nearby team members. Healing or Damage done depends on whether there are any nearby enemies and the current **HP** of team members.
* Can act as a debuffer with **Viridescent Venerer** 4-set.

## Additional Notes

* **C1** removes **HP** restrictions on Sayu's **Elemental Burst** and allows the summoned **Daruma** to heal and deal damage at the same time.
* **C4 **allows Sayu to recover energy whenever she triggers a **Swirl** reaction.
* **C6** allows her to use **Elemental Mastery** to give an **Attack%** bonus as well as **HP%** bonus to the **Daruma** during the **Elemental Burst.**

* Sayu pairs well with almost all characters in the game as **Viridescent Venerer** 4-set can debuff **Elemental Resistance** on enemies for 4 of the elements (**Cryo**, **Electro**, **Hydro**, and **Pyro**).

## Does Not Work Well With

* **Anemo **cannot cause **Elemental Reactions** with **Geo** and **Viridescent Venerer** cannot provide debuffing for **Geo **and** Physical **Damage characters.
  * Sayu can still be used with these characters if your team requires healing but will provide little other value.
