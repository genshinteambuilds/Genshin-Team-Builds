# Kazuha

## Roles

* **Support:** Buffer (A4, C2), Debuffer (VV), Crowd Control (Grouping), Energy Battery
* **Off-Field DPS** (Elemental Burst)
* **Main DPS** (C6)

## Character Breakdown

* **Elemental Skill** creates a vacuum that launches Kazuha into the air and can group smaller enemies.
  * Performing a **Plunging Attack** after using his **Elemental Skill** creates a "small wind tunnel" and groups enemies.
* **Elemental Burst** creates a field that can absorb **Cryo**, **Electro**, **Hydro**, or **Pyro** and will continually deal damage of that elemental type along with **Anemo** and **Swirl** **DMG**.
  * Once the **Elemental Burst** absorbs an element, enemies within the field are periodically damaged with that element, allowing other **Elemental Reactions** with that element to frequently take place.
* **A4** makes any element **Swirled** by Kazuha give the entire team an **Elemental DMG** boost to that element, proportional to his **Elemental Mastery.**
  * Kazuha can reach **Elemental Mastery** values as high as 1000, which gives 40% additional **Elemental DMG** for any swirled element.
* Kazuha can **Swirl** multiple different elements quite easily, providing buffs and debuffs for those elements with his **A4** and **Viridescent Venerer.**
* **Anemo** characters need to be within 20 levels of enemies to be able to Crowd Control them most effectively.

## **Additional Notes**

* **C1** resets the cooldown of Kazuha's **Elemental Skill** after using his **Elemental Burst.**
* **C2** increases the entire team's **Elemental Mastery** by 200 after using Kazuha's **Elemental Burst.**
* **C4** allows Kazuha to generate much more energy for himself.
* **C6** infuses Kazuha's attacks with **Anemo** and boosts their **DMG** by 0.2% of his **Elemental Mastery**. This allows him to be used as the Main DPS character in an [**Anemo**](../../teams/anemo.md) team.

## Works Well With

* Kazuha pairs well with almost all characters in the game as **Viridescent Venerer** 4-set can debuff **Elemental RES** on enemies for 4 of the elements (**Cryo**, **Electro**, **Hydro**, and **Pyro**).

## Does Not Work Well With

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/element\_geo.webp)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_eula.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_razor.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_xinyan.png)

* **Anemo** cannot cause **Elemental Reactions** with **Geo** and **Viridescent Venerer** cannot provide debuffing for **Geo** and **Physical DMG** characters.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_xiao.png)

* Kazuha cannot buff **Anemo** **DMG** as **Anemo** cannot be absorbed into his **Elemental Burst.** Other **Anemo** characters with more powerful Crowd Control abilities or other utility are often preferred in an **Anemo** team composition that uses Xiao as a Main DPS as a result.

* Only recommended if Kazuha is **C6.**

{% hint style="info" %}
In the following teams, Kazuha provides debuffing utility using the **Viridescent Venerer** 4-set and can also provide boosts to multiple **Elemental DMG** types.

#### [Freeze (Cryo)](../../teams/freeze.md)

* Kazuha can apply either **Hydro** or **Cryo** with his **Elemental Burst** and help enable **AoE Freeze** teams.

* While Kazuha's **Elemental Skill** can provide decent **Crowd Control** and his **Elemental Burst** can cause **Overload** reactions, this may not work efficiently for large numbers of smaller enemies that are displaced by Overload's knock back.

#### [Pure Pyro](../../teams/pure-pyro.md)
