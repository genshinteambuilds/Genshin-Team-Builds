# Kazuha

## Roles

* **Support** \(Buffer, Debuffer, Crowd Control, Energy Battery\)
* **Main DPS** \(Requires C6\)

## Character Breakdown

* Elemental Skill creates a vacuum which launches Kazuha into the air and can group smaller enemies.
* Performing a Plunge Attack after using his Elemental Skill creates a "small wind tunnel" and groups enemies. 
* Elemental Burst creates a field that that can absorb Cryo, Electro, Hydro or Pyro and will continually deal damage of that elemental type along with anemo and swirl damage.  
* At A4, any element swirled by Kazuha will give the entire team an elemental damage boost of 0.04% of Kazuha's EM.
  * Kazuha can reach EM values as high as 1000 which would give 40% additiona damage for any swirled element.
* Will act as a Debuffer with Viridescent Venerer 4-set.
* Once the Elemental Burst absorbs an element, enemies within the field are continually damaged with that element, allowing other Elemental Reactions with that element to constantly take place.

## **Additional Notes**

* Kazuha can swirl multiple elements quite easily, providing Buffs and Debuffs for those elements with his A4 and Viridescent Venerer.
* C2 increases the entire team's EM by 200 after using Kazuha's Elemental Burst.
* C4 allows Kazuha generate much more Energy for himself.
* C6 infuses Kazuha's attacks with Anemo and boosts their damage by 0.2% of his EM. This allows him to be used as the Main DPS character in an [Anemo team.](../../teams/anemo.md)

* Kazuha pairs well with almost all characters in the game as Viridescent Venerer 4-set can Debuff Elemental Resistance on enemies for 4 of the elements \(Cryo, Electro, Hydro and Pyro\).
* With other Anemo characters, Kazuha can act as a Battery and also receive energy from other anemo characters.
* Kazuha can buff up to 3 other Elements in his party, allows for variety in Elemental Reactions
  * Can even run him in mono element teams, and he still does fine as a buffer/debuffer.

## Does Not Work Well With

* Kazuha cannot cause elemental reactions with Geo and cannot provide Debuffing for Physical Damage characters.

* Kazuha cannot buff Anemo damage as Anemo cannot be absorbed into his Elemental Burst. Other Anemo characters with more powerful Crowd Control abilities or other utility are often preferred in an Anemo team composition as a result.
