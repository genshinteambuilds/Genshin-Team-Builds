# Jean

## Roles

* **Support:** Healer, Debuffer (VV, C4), Energy Battery, Cleanser, Crowd Control (Grouping), Buffer (C2)
* **Burst DPS**

## Character Breakdown

* **A1** gives **Normal Attacks** and **Charged Attacks** a 50% chance to heal the party for 15% of Jean's **ATK**.
* **Elemental Skill** **(Tap)** deals **Anemo DMG** and can knock back enemies.
* **Elemental Skill** **(Hold)** can gather smaller enemies when held. Releasing the skill throws enemies in the direction Jean is facing which can cause them to take fall damage when they collide with walls or are flung sufficiently high into the air.
* **Elemental Burst** deals a large amount of **Anemo DMG** and heals a large amount when used.
* **Elemental Burst** also creates a **Dandelion Field** which continuously heals characters that stand in it.
* **Elemental Burst** cleanses debuffs from all team members.
* Can act as a Debuffer with **Viridescent Venerer** 4-set or as a buffer with **Noblesse Oblige** 4-set if running 2 **Anemo** supports.
* **Anemo** characters need to be within 20 levels of enemies to be able to Crowd Control them most effectively.

## **Additional Notes**

* Often paired with another **Anemo** character to act as an Energy Battery for them and also to regenerate energy for herself, as her **Elemental Burst** has a high energy requirement.
* **C4** reduces the **Anemo Elemental Resistance** of enemies standing within the field created by her **Elemental Burst** by 40%.
* Jean's healing scales off **ATK**.
* **Charged Attacks** can cause smaller enemies to float in the air for a short period of time after they are hit.

## Works Well With

* Jean pairs well with almost all characters in the game as **Viridescent Venerer** 4-set can debuff **Elemental Resistance** on enemies for 4 of the Elements (**Cryo**, **Electro**, **Hydro**, and **Pyro**).
* You should generally avoid pairing Jean with another Healer as Jean's healing is sufficient for most content.
  * Bennett + Jean is one exception to this rule in situations where this exact pairing can combine **Elemental Bursts** to trigger **Swirl** and quickly destroy enemy shields.

## Does Not Work Well With

* **Anemo** cannot cause **Elemental Reactions** with **Geo** and **Viridescent Venerer** cannot provide debuffing for **Geo** and **Physical DMG** characters.
  * Jean can still be used with these characters if your team requires healing but will provide little other value.
