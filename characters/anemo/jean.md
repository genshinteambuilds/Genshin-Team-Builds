# Jean

## Roles

* **Support: **Healer, Debuffer (VV, C4), Energy Battery, Cleanser, Crowd Control (Grouping), Buffer (C2)
* **Burst DPS**

## Character Breakdown

* Elemental Skill deals damage and can knock back enemies when tapped. 
* Elemental Skill can gather smaller enemies when held. These enemies can then be thrown into the air causing them to take a significant percentage of their HP as fall damage when they land.
* Elemental Burst both deals a large amount of damage and heals a large amount when used.
* Elemental Burst also creates a Dandelion Field which continuously heals characters that stand in it.
* Her Elemental Burst can remove (cleanse) all elemental debuffs.
* Can act as a Debuffer with Viridescent Venerer 4-set or as a Buffer with Noblesse Oblige 4-set if running 2 Anemo supports.

## **Additional Notes**

* Often paired with another Anemo character to act as an Energy Battery for them and also to regenerate energy for herself, as her Elemental Burst has a high energy requirement.
* Both her Elemental Skill and Burst can deal significant damage when properly built.
* C4 reduces the Anemo Resistance of enemies standing within the field created by her Elemental Burst by 40%.
* Anemo characters need to be within 20 levels of enemies to be able to crowd control them most effectively.

## Works Well With

* Jean pairs well with almost all characters in the game as Viridescent Venerer 4-set can Debuff Elemental Resistance on enemies for 4 of the elements (Cryo, Electro, Hydro and Pyro).
* Jean can act as an Energy Battery for other Anemo characters, while those other Anemo characters can in turn act as Energy Batteries for Jean, as well.
* You should generally avoid pairing Jean with another healer as Jean's healing is sufficient for most content.
  * Bennett + Jean is one exception to this rule in situations where this exact pairing can help deal with shields in Spiral Abyss.
