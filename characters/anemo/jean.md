# Jean

## Roles

* **Support:** Healer, Debuffer, Crowd Control, Energy Battery, Cleanser
* **Burst DPS**

## Character Breakdown

* Elemental Skill deals damage and can knock back enemies when tapped. 
* Elemental Skill can gather smaller enemies when held. These enemies can then be thrown into the air causing them to take a significant percentage of their HP as fall damage when they land.
* Elemental Burst both deals a large amount of damage and heals a large amount when used.
* Elemental Burst also creates a Dandelion Field which continuously heals characters that stand in it.
* Her Elemental Burst can remove \(cleanse\) all elemental debuffs.
* Will act as a Debuffer with Viridescent Venerer 4-set or as a Buffer with Noblesse Oblige 4-set if running 2 anemo supports.

## **Additional Notes**

* Often paired with another anemo character to help battery them and also to get regenerate energy for herself as her Elemental Burst has a high energy requirement.
* Both her Elemental Skill and Burst can deal quite significant damage when properly built.
* C4 reduces the Anemo Resistance of enemies standing within the field created by her Elemental Burst by 40%.
* Anemo characters need to be within 20 levels of enemies to be able to displace them fully with their abilities.

## Works Well With

* Jean pairs well with almost all characters in the game as Viridescent Venerer 4-set can Debuff Elemental Resistance on enemies for 4 of the elements \(Cryo, Electro, Hydro and Pyro\).
* With other Anemo characters, Jean can act as a Battery and also receive energy from other anemo characters.
* You should generally avoid pairing Jean with another healer as Jean is sufficient healing by herself.
  * Bennett + Jean is one exception to this rule in situations where this exact pairing can help deal with shields in Spiral Abyss.

## Does Not Work Well With

#### [Anemo](./)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_xiao.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_jean.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_albedo.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_zhongli.png) 

* Jean is primarily acting as a Battery for Xiao in this composition and is additionally providing some CC and Healing utility.
* While Albedo and Zhongli cannot provide reactions with anemo, their Off-Field Damage in the case of Albedo and Shielding / Debuffing utility in the case of Zhongli allows Xiao to continuing dealing damage as a Selfish DPS.

#### [Electro-Charged](../../teams/electro-charged.md)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_keqing.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_fischl.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_xingqiu.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_jean.png) 

* In this team, Jean provides an Elemental Resistance Debuff using the Viridescent Venerer 4-set and also provides healing and burst damage.

#### [Reverse Vaporize](../../teams/reverse-vaporize.md)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_diluc.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_xingqiu.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_zhongli.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_jean.png) 

* Similar to the above, Jean provides an Elemental Resistance Debuff using the Viridescent Venerer 4-set and also provides healing and burst damage.

#### [Raw Pyro](../../teams/pyro.md)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_klee.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_xiangling.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_venti.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_jean.png) 

* In this team, Jean will typically allow Venti to take the role of being a debuffer with the Viridescent 4-set and instead provide the team with a Noblesse Oblige 4-set buff.
* Jean can both help recharge Venti's energy and be recharged by Venti's Elemental Skill.
* At C4, Jean's Elemental Burst will increase Venti's damage during Jean's Elemental Burst.

#### [Turbo / Overload](../../teams/overload.md)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_xiangling.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_fischl.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_venti.png) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_jean.png) 

* A similar setup to the above except using a Quickswap setup where all members have fairly low Elemental Skill cooldowns and all members constantly generate energy particles to fuel their Elemental Bursts.
* Overload scattering enemies is negated by Venti's CC.
