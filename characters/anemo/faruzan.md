# Faruzan

## Roles

* **Support**: Buffer, Debuffer (VV), Crowd Control (Grouping)

## Character Breakdown

* **Elemental Skill** deals **AoE** **Anemo DMG** by deploying a polyhedron. Enters Faruzan into the **Manifest Gale** state that allows her to fire a **Hurricane Arrow** which deals **AoE** **Anemo DMG** and creates a vortex (**Pressurized Collapse)**
  * **A1** reduces **Charge Shot** time by 60% and also applies **Perfidious Wind's Gale** to enemies,
* **Elemental Burst** creates a **Dazzling Polyhedron** that releases **Whirlwind Pulses**
  * Opponents hit by a **Whirlwind Pulse** gain the **Perfidious Wind's Gale** status which decreases **Anemo resistance** by 30%.
  * Team members gain the **Prayerful Wind's Benefit** status which grants increased **Anemo DMG.**
* **A4** grants all members affected by **Prayerful Wind's Benefit** a **DMG** increase based on 32% of Faruzan's **ATK** for **Anemo** **DMG**

## **Additional Notes**

* **C6** grants characters affected by **Prayerful Wind's Benefit** 40% **Crit DMG** and triggers a **Pressurized Collapse** effect on opponents every 3 seconds&#x20;

* Faruzan is meant to be an **Anemo** specific buffer, however she can pair well with almost all characters in the game as **Viridescent Venerer** 4-set can debuff **Elemental RES** on enemies for 4 of the elements (**Cryo**, **Electro**, **Hydro**, and **Pyro**).

* **Anemo** cannot cause **Elemental Reactions** with **Geo** and **Viridescent Venerer** cannot provide debuffing for **Geo** and **Physical DMG** characters.

* This team makes use of **Electro** and **Hydro** Off-Field DPS while Heizou creates **Swirl** Reactions with her **Elemental Skill, Normal Attacks** and **Charged Attacks**, buffing the teams' **Elemental Mastery** while decreasing enemies **Electro** and **Hydro** **RES**.
* Note: This team does not contain a dedicated healer and is not included within the Electro-Charged team page for that reason. Kokomi Taser team compositions have largely replaced Sucrose Taser teams due to the ability for Kokomi to provide healing.
