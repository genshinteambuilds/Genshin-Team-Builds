# Sucrose

## Roles

* **Support**: Buffer (A4, C6), Debuffer (VV), Crowd Control (Grouping), Energy Battery
* **Off-Field DPS** (Elemental Burst)

## Character Breakdown

* **Elemental Skill** creates a small Wind Spirit that pulls opponents towards it's location and launches up opponents within it's AoE into the air.
* **Elemental Burst** creates a field that that can absorb **Cryo, Electro, Hydro **or** Pyro** and will continuously deal damage of that elemental type. If no element is absorbed, the field will only deal **Anemo** damage.
  * Once the **Elemental Burst** absorbs an element, enemies within the field are continuously damaged with that element, allowing other **Elemental Reactions** with that element to constantly take place.
* **A1 **raises the **Elemental Mastery** of all characters besides Sucrose whenever Sucrose triggers a **Swirl** reaction.
  * This **Elemental Mastery **buff only applies to characters matching the element she **Swirls** with.
* **A4** allows Sucrose to share 20% of her **Elemental Mastery** with her team members when her **Elemental Skill** or **Elemental Burst** hits an opponent.
  * Sucrose can reach **Elemental Mastery** values as high as 1000 which would give 250 **Elemental Mastery** to her party members with both **A1** and **A4** talents.
* Can act as a debuffer with **Viridescent Venerer** 4-set.

## **Additional Notes**

* **Elemental Skill** can also stagger larger enemies such as Geovishaps.
* **Elemental Skill** and **Elemental Burst** are useful for Crowd Control.
* **C1** gives her **Elemental Skill** an additional charge.
* **C6** allows Sucrose to boost **Elemental** Damage by 20% for the element absorbed by her Elemental Burst.

* Sucrose pairs well with almost all characters in the game as **Viridescent Venerer** 4-set can debuff **Elemental Resistance** on enemies for 4 of the elements (**Cryo, Electro, Hydro, and Pyro**).
* Sucrose can act as an energy battery for other **Anemo** characters, while those other **Anemo** characters can in turn act as energy batteries for Kazuha, as well. She is especially good with her **C1.**

## Does Not Work Well With

* **Anemo **cannot cause **Elemental Reactions** with **Geo** and **Viridescent Venerer** cannot provide debuffing for **Geo **and** Physical **Damage characters.
  * She can however could still be used for Crowd Control.

#### [Anemo](./)

* Sucrose is primarily acts as an energy battery for Xiao in this team and additionally provides some Crowd Control.
  * With **Sacrificial Fragments** and **C1,** she can use her **Elemental Skill** 3 times in quick succession, which is one of the fastest ways to recharge Xiao's Energy.

{% hint style="info" %}
In all the teams listed below, Sucrose universally provides debuffing using the **Viridescent Venerer** 4-set and can also provide boosts to multiple elemental damage types.
{% endhint %}

#### [Electro-Charged (Electro)](../../teams/electro-charged.md)

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Beidou.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Fischl.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Sucrose.png)

* Often referred to as the Taser team, this team makes use of **Electro** and **Hydro** off-field DPS while Sucrose creates **Swirl** Reactions with her **Elemental Skill, Normal Attacks** and **Charged Attacks**, buffing the teams' **Elemental Mastery** while decreasing enemies **Electro** and **Hydro** **Resistance.**

#### [Freeze (Cryo)](../../teams/freeze.md)

* Even though **Elemental Mastery** doesn't benefit **Frozen** **Elemental Reactions**, Sucrose can still infuse either **Hydro** or **Cryo** with her **Elemental Burst** and help enable longer **Freeze** time.

#### [Melt (Cryo)](../../teams/reverse-melt.md)

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Ganyu.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xiangling.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Sucrose.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)

* Sucrose's **Elemental Burst** can infuse with **Pyro** allowing the **Cryo** Main DPS to **Reverse Melt.** Her **Elemental Mastery** buff also helps the **Cryo** Main DPS to deal more **Reverse Melt** damage.&#x20;

#### [Vaporize (Pyro)](../../teams/reverse-vaporize.md)

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Diluc.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Sucrose.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)

* Sucrose provides **Elemental Mastery** for the team to deal more **Vaporize** damage, as well as Crowd Control with her **Elemental Skill** and **Elemental Burst.** She also decreases **Pyro Resistance** for the **Pyro** Main DPS to deal more damage.
