# Sucrose

## Roles

* **Support**: Buffer (A4, C6), Debuffer (VV), Crowd Control (Grouping), Energy Battery
* **Off-Field DPS** (Elemental Burst)

## Character Breakdown

* Elemental Skill creates a small Wind Spirit that pulls opponents towards it's location and launches up opponents within it's AoE.
* Elemental Burst creates an AoE field that that can absorb Cryo, Electro, Hydro or Pyro and will continuously deal damage of that elemental type. If no element is absorbed, the field will only deal Anemo damage.
  * Once the Elemental Burst absorbs an element, enemies within the field are continuously damaged with that element, allowing other Elemental Reactions with that element to constantly take place.
* At A1, when Sucrose triggers a Swirl Reaction, All characters besides sucrose have their Elemental Mastery increased by 50 for 8 seconds.
* At A4, when Sucrose uses her Elemental Skill or Burst on an opponent, she shares an additional 20% of her Elemental Mastery with her party members.
  * Sucrose can reach EM values as high as 1000 which would give 250 EM to her party members with both A1 and A4 talents.
* Will act as a Debuffer with Viridescent Venerer 4-set.

## **Additional Notes**

* Elemental Skill can also stagger larger enemies such as Geovishaps.
* Both her Elemental Skill and Burst are useful for grouping enemies.
* C1 gives her Elemental Skill an additional charge, great as an energy battery.
* C6 Sucrose has the ability to boost Elemental Damage by 20% for any element absorbed during her Elemental Burst.

## Works Well With

* Sucrose pairs well with almost all characters in the game as Viridescent Venerer 4-set can Debuff Elemental Resistance on enemies for 4 of the elements (Cryo, Electro, Hydro and Pyro).
* With other Anemo characters, Sucrose acts as a Battery and also receive energy from other Anemo characters, especially good with her C1.

## Does Not Work Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Geo.webp)

* Sucrose cannot cause elemental reactions with Geo characters in general (could still be used as a form of crowd control in the team).

* Sucrose with 4 Viridescent Venerer can only lower enemies Elemental RES, so she provides little to nothing for these physical damage dealers.

* Sucrose is primarily acting as a Battery for Xiao in this composition and is additionally providing some crowd control.
  * With Sacrificial Fragments and C1, she can use her Elemental Skill 3 times in succession, which is one of the fastest ways to recharge Xiao's Energy.

#### [Electro-Charged](../../teams/electro-charged.md)

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Beidou.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Fischl.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Sucrose.png)

* Often referred to as the Taser team composition, this team makes use of Electro and Hydro off-field DPS while Sucrose creates Swirl Reactions with her Elemental Skill, Normal and Charged Attacks, buffing the teams' Elemental Mastery while decreasing enemies Electro and Hydro RES.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Diluc.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xingqiu.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Sucrose.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)
