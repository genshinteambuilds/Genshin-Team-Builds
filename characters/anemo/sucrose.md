# Sucrose

## Roles

* **Support** \(Buffer, Debuffer, Crowd Control, Energy Battery\)

## Character Breakdown

* Elemental Skill creates a small Wind Spirit that pulls opponents towards it's location and launches opponents within it's AoE.
* Elemental Burst creates a field that that can absorb Cryo, Electro, Hydro or Pyro and will continually deal damage of that elemental type. If no element is absorbed, the field deals Anemo damage.
* When Sucrose triggers a Swirl Reaction, Sucrose buffs teammates by 50 Elemental Mastery
* At A4, when Sucrose uses her Elemental Skill or Burst on an opponent, she shares an additional 20% of her Elemental Mastery with her party members.
  * With about 1000 EM, Sucrose will buff allies by 250 Elemental Mastery
* Will act as a Debuffer with Viridescent Venerer 4-set.
* Once the Elemental Burst absorbs an element, enemies within the field are continually damaged with that element, allowing other Elemental Reactions with that element to constantly take place.

## **Additional Notes**

*  * Elemental Skill can also stagger larger enemies such and Geovishaps
* * Both her Elemental Skill and Burst are notable in terms of crowd control 
* C1 gives her Skill an additional charge
* C6 Sucrose has the ability to boost Elemental Damage by 20% for any element absorbed during her Elemental Burst

* Sucrose pairs well with almost all characters in the game as Viridescent Venerer 4-set can Debuff Elemental Resistance on enemies for 4 of the elements \(Cryo, Electro, Hydro and Pyro\).
* With other Anemo characters, Sucrose can act as a Battery and also receive energy from other anemo characters.
* Sucrose gets the most value out of being run in Melt/Vaporize teams, as Elemental Mastery scales really well these kind of Amplifying Reaction
