# Xiao

## Roles

* **Main DPS \(**Hypercarry\)

## Character Breakdown

* Elemental Skill has two charges and allows Xiao to dash quickly at an opponent and deal Anemo Damage
* Elemental Burst gives Xiao an Anemo Infusion and a Damage Bonus on Normal, Charged, and Plunge Attacks. Additionally Xiao's jump height is greatly increased, allowing for a Plunge centric playstyle for maximum damage output
* Plunge Attacks during Xiao's Burst produce Anemo spears from the ground which have a significant Area of Effect

## **Additional Notes**

* Xiao should usually played with another Anemo character in order to provide energy to fuel his Elemental Burst.
  * Usually 120-130% Energy Recharge is recommended with an Anemo battery
* Xiao continuously loses HP during his Burst
* C1 gives Xiao an extra charge to his Elemental Skill, C6 allows him to reset his Skill cooldown after a Plunge Attack.
* Xiao cannot generate Elemental Particles during the duration of his Burst, and is often referred to as a "Selfish DPS"

* Unlike other Anemo characters, Xiao has limited team Elemental synergy
* As a Main DPS "Hypercarry," Xiao fits well on teams that can amplify Anemo Damage, which is quite rare without high constellations
  * Geo and Pyro Resonance are both useful in boosting Xiao's Damage

## Does Not Work Well With

* As a Hypercarry, Xiao does not synergize well with other characters that need to stay on field in order to do damage
* Physical Damage characters usually cannot buff Xiao or support him in anyway

* Geo Resonance is an effective way to boost Xiao's damage while protected by Zhongli's Shield. Albedo provides Off-Field DPS which can be activated by Xiao
* Zhongli's Shield reduces Enemy Anemo resistance, as well as C4 Jean's Burst
* Anemo Battery is recommended in order to ensure constant Burst uptime.

* Bennett's Burst Attack buff is very effective at boosting Xiao's DPS

#### [Pyro](../pyro/#teams)

* Pyro Resonance's 25% Attack increase is very useful for Xiao
* Xiangling provides Off-Field DPS
