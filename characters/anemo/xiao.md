# Xiao

## Roles

* **Main DPS** (Selfish)

## Character Breakdown

* **Elemental Skill** has two charges and allows Xiao to dash quickly at an opponent dealing **Anemo** **DMG**.
* **Elemental Burst** infuses Xiao's weapon with **Anemo** and provides a **DMG Bonus** to his **Normal, Charged,** and **Plunging Attacks.** Additionally, Xiao's jump height is greatly increased, allowing Xiao to jump and perform **Plunging Attacks** continually while his **Elemental Burst** is active.
  * Xiao continuously loses **HP** throughout the duration of his **Elemental Burst.**
  * **Plunging Attacks** performed during Xiao's **Elemental Burst** produce **Anemo** spears from the ground which deal **Anemo DMG** in a large area around him.

## **Additional Notes**

* Xiao is often played with another Anemo character that can provide energy to fuel his **Elemental Burst**.
* **C1** gives Xiao an extra charge to his **Elemental Skill.**
* **C6** allows Xiao to reset his **Elemental Skill** cooldown after a **Plunging Attack.**
* Xiao cannot generate **Elemental Particles** during the duration of his **Elemental Burst,** and is often referred to as a Selfish Main DPS as swapping off of Xiao during his **Elemental Burst** will cancel it.

## Works Well With

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_zhongli.png)

* Xiao works particularly well with Zhongli as he provides one of the few debuffs that work for **Anemo** **DMG**. His shielding also helps Xiao from taking additional damage during his **Elemental Burst**.

* Raiden replaces the slot for the dedicated **Anemo** battery.
* Because she deals considerable damage, she is able to finish mobs during Xiao's **Elemental Burst** downtime, saving his **Elemental Burst** for the next wave of enemies.
* As a universal battery, Raiden is able to battery units that would otherwise be too energy demanding to run with Xiao. Some examples are: Lisa, Xiangling and Yae.

* Sucrose, Venti, and Jean are able to generate **Anemo** **Particles** to help Xiao regain energy for his **Elemental Burst**. This is particularly notable since Xiao's relies heavily on having his **Elemental Burst** active as frequently as possible.

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_icon\_geo.webp)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_icon\_pyro.webp)

* Unlike other Anemo characters which are often used in a supporting role, Xiao has limited synergy with other elements such as **Cryo**, **Electro** or **Hydro** as **Elemental Reactions** cannot be used to boost Xiao's **Anemo DMG**.
* **Geo** and **Pyro Resonance** can be used to buff Xiao directly.

## Does Not Work Well With

* As a Selfish Main DPS character, Xiao does not work well with other characters that must stay on the field.
* **Physical** **DMG** characters usually cannot buff Xiao or support him in any way.

Xiao only really works in an **Anemo** team where Xiao works as the Selfish Main DPS. One example team is shown below. Additional teams and options can be found in the **Anemo** team page.

* **Geo Resonance** is an effective way to boost Xiao's **Anemo DMG**.
* Albedo provides Off-Field **Geo DMG** with his **Elemental Skill.**
* Zhongli provides Shielding and decreases the enemy's **Elemental RES** with his **Elemental Skill.**
* Jean provides Healing as well as acts as an energy battery for Xiao.

* Xiao performs the role of the Main DPS.
* Raiden provides Energy for Xiao and the rest of the team, while contributing a substantial amount of damage herself.
* Yae Miko contributes off-field damage through her **Elemental Skill**. Her **Elemental Burst** is recharged through Raiden's **Elemental Burst's** Energy restoration.
* Zhongli provides survival to the team with his strong shield and -20% **Elemental RES** shred.
