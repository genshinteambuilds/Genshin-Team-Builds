# Anemo

{% hint style="info" %}
All Anemo Characters can use the \*\*Viridescent Venerer 4-set. \*\*The effect description reads:\
_"Increases Swirl DMG by 60%. Decreases opponent's Elemental RES to the element infused in the Swirl by 40% for 10s."_\
\__This means that any Anemo character can be a Debuffer and this set is a must-have for almost all Anemo Support characters. Do \_\*\*NOT \*\*\_put this set on an Anemo Main DPS.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
For the Elemental Resistance debuff to take effect, the character with the set **must be on the field** at the time of the first Swirl reaction and switch out only after the Swirl. Using an Anemo ability and switching before the Swirl reaction happens will result in the debuff not activating.

## Teams

{% hint style="info" %}
We have not included every team here as Anemo characters can be used in virtually all team compositions.

Anemo supports are some of the most commonly used characters that can provide Debuffing via Viridescent Venerer and Crowd Control for the team.
