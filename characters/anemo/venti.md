# Venti

## Roles

* **Support**: Debuffer (VV, C2, C6), Crowd Control (Grouping), Energy Battery
* **Off-Field DPS** (Elemental Burst)

## Character Breakdown

* **Elemental Skill (Tap)** deals **AoE** **Anemo** **DMG** in front of Venti and launches enemies hit into the air.
* **Elemental Skill (Hold)** deals increased **AoE** **Anemo** **DMG** around Venti and launches him into the air.
* **Elemental Burst** creates a massive **Stormeye** that sucks in opponents and continuously deals **Anemo** **DMG**. The Stormeye can absorb **Cryo**, **Electro**, **Hydro** or **Pyro** and will continuously deal additional **DMG** of that elemental type.
* **Anemo** characters need to be within 20 levels of enemies to be able to Crowd Control them most effectively.

## **Additional Notes**

* **A1** creates an upward current that the active characters can use to glide into the air when using **Elemental Skill** (Hold).
* **A4** regenerates 15 energy for Venti after his **Elemental Burst** ends. If the **Elemental Burst** is infused with an element, every character with that infused element gains 15 energy.
* **C2** debuffs **Anemo RES** whenever enemies are hit by Venti's **Elemental Skill.**
* **C6** debuffs **Anemo RES** and **Elemental RES** of the absorbed element when enemies are hit by Venti's **Elemental Burst.**

## Works Well With

* Venti pairs well with almost all characters in the game as **Viridescent Venerer** 4-set can debuff **Elemental RES** on enemies for 4 of the elements (**Cryo**, **Electro**, **Hydro**, and **Pyro**).

## Does Not Work Well With

#### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/element\_geo.webp)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_eula.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_razor.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_xinyan.png)

* **Anemo** cannot cause **Elemental Reactions** with **Geo** and **Viridescent Venerer** cannot provide debuffing for **Geo** and **Physical DMG** characters.
  * Venti can still provide the team with Crowd Control utility
