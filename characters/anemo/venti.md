# Venti

## Roles

* \*\*Support: \*\*Debuffer (VV, C2, C6), Crowd Control (Grouping), Energy Battery
* **Off-Field DPS** (Elemental Burst)

## Character Breakdown

* Elemental Skill (Tap) deals AOE Anemo damage in front of Venti and launches enemies hit into the air.
* Elemental Skill (Hold) deals increased AOE Anemo damage around Venti and launches him into the air.
* Elemental Burst creates a massive Stormeye that sucks in opponents in the middle and deals continuous Anemo damage. If the Stormeye comes into contact to any other elements besides Anemo or Geo, it will deal additional elemental damage depending on the element that is infused.

## **Additional Notes**

* A1 creates an upward current that the active characters can use to glide into the air when using Elemental Skill (Hold).
* A4 regenerates 15 energy for Venti after his Elemental Burst ends. If the Elemental Burst is infused with an element, every character with that infused element gains 15 energy.
* Debuffs Anemo Resistance at C2 when enemies are hit by Venti's Elemental Skill.
* Debuffs Anemo Resistance and Elemental Resistance of the swirled element at C6 when enemies are hit by Venti's Elemental Burst.

* Venti pairs well with almost all characters in the game as Viridescent Venerer 4-set can Debuff Elemental Resistance on enemies besides Anemo (which can be decreased with constellations) and Geo.
* With other Anemo characters, Venti can act as a Battery and also receive energy from other Anemo characters.

## Does Not Work Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Eula.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Razor.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xinyan.png)

* Venti does not work well with Physical damage dealers since he can't provide any debuffing for them.

* Venti doesn't synergize well with Geo since they don't cause any elemental reactions with one another.
