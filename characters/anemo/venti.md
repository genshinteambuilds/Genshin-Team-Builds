# Venti

## Roles

* **Support**: Debuffer (VV, C2, C6), Crowd Control (Grouping), Energy Battery
* **Off-Field DPS** (Elemental Burst)

## Character Breakdown

* **Elemental Skill** (Tap) deals AoE **Anemo** damage in front of Venti and launches enemies hit into the air.
* **Elemental Skill **(Hold) deals increased AoE **Anemo** damage around Venti and launches him into the air.
* **Elemental Burst** creates a massive **Stormeye** that sucks in opponents and continuously deals **Anemo** damage. The Stormeye can absorb **Cryo, Electro, Hydro** or **Pyro** and will continuously deal additional damage of that elemental type.

## **Additional Notes**

* **A1 **creates an upward current that the active characters can use to glide into the air when using **Elemental Skill** (Hold).
* **A4** regenerates 15 energy for Venti after his **Elemental Burst** ends. If the **Elemental Burst** is infused with an element, every character with that infused element gains 15 energy.
* **C2 **debuffs **Anemo Resistance** whenever enemies are hit by Venti's **Elemental Skill.**
* **C6 **debuffs **Anemo Resistance** and **Elemental Resistance** of the absorbed element when enemies are hit by Venti's **Elemental Burst.**

* Venti pairs well with almost all characters in the game as **Viridescent Venerer** 4-set can debuff **Elemental Resistance** on enemies besides **Anemo** (which can be decreased with **constellations**) and **Geo.**
* With other **Anemo** characters, **Venti** can act as an energy battery and also receive energy from other **Anemo** characters.

## Does Not Work Well With

* **Anemo **cannot cause **Elemental Reactions** with **Geo** and **Viridescent Venerer** cannot provide debuffing for **Geo **and** Physical **Damage characters.
  * He can however could still be used for Crowd Control.
