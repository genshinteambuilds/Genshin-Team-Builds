# Heizou

## Roles

* **Support**: Buffer (A4), Debuffer (VV), Crowd Control (Grouping)
* **On-Field DPS**

## Character Breakdown

* **Elemental Skill** attacks an enemy with a Heartstopper Strike dealing **Anemo DMG**.
* **Elemental Skill** (**Hold**) charges the **Heartstopper Strike**. Heizou gains a maximum of 4 **Decension** stacks and depending on how long the skill is held and produces the **Conviction** effect which makes the Heartstopper Strike stronger and have increased **AoE**.
* Elemental Burst fires a **Fudou Style Vacuum Slugger** that explode upon hitting enemies and leaves behind a vacuum that sucks them in, dealing **Anemo** **DMG**. When **Fudou Style Vacuum Slugger** hits enemies affected by **Cryo**, **Electro**, **Hydro** or **Pyro** they get affected by **Windmaster Iris** which then explodes dealing **AoE** damage of the first element it absorbs.
* **A1** allows Heizou to gain **Descension Stacks** when he triggers a **Swirl** Reaction. This can only be done once every 0.1 seconds.
* **A4** allows Heizou to buff the entire party with 80 **Elemental Mastery** for 10 seconds when **Heartstopper Strike** hits enemies.

## **Additional Notes**

* Heizou mainly acts as an On-Field DPS to debuff enemy **Elemental Resistances** with **Viridescent Venerer** through **Swirl** reactions allowing Off-field DPS to deal more damage.
* **C1** increases Heizou's **ATK** speed for 5s when he is On-field and grants him 1 **Descension** stack.
* **C4** grants Heizou energy when casting his **Elemental Burst**.
* **C6** grants Heizou with 4% **CRIT Rate** based on the number of **Decension** stacks and 32% **CRIT DMG** when possessing the **Conviction** buff.

* Heizou pairs well with almost all characters in the game as **Viridescent Venerer** 4-set can debuff **Elemental RES** on enemies for 4 of the elements (**Cryo**, **Electro**, **Hydro**, and **Pyro**).

* This team makes use of **Electro** and **Hydro** Off-Field DPS while Heizou creates **Swirl** Reactions with her **Elemental Skill, Normal Attacks** and **Charged Attacks**, buffing the teams' **Elemental Mastery** while decreasing enemies **Electro** and **Hydro** **RES**.
* Note: This team does not contain a dedicated healer and is not included within the Electro-Charged team page for that reason. Kokomi Taser team compositions have largely replaced Sucrose Taser teams due to the ability for Kokomi to provide healing.
