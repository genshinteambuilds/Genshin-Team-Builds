# Wanderer

## Roles

* **Main DPS**

## Character Breakdown

* **Elemental Skill** deals **AoE Anemo Damage** and enters a special state.
  * In this state, Wanderer becomes airborne, gains a resource similar to **Stamina**, and **Normal** and **Charged Attacks** have their **AoE** increased.
  * Wanderer uses his resource constantly to maintain his aerial state, and will use more when he does the following:
    * Uses **Normal Attacks.**
    * Dashes mid-air (sprints).
    * Rises vertically (jumps).
* **Elemental Burst** deals several hits of **AoE Anemo Damage** and, if cast while Wanderer's **Elemental Skill** is active, will forcibly end it.
* **A1** gives Wanderer up to two buffs depending on what elements were **Swirled** upon activation of Wanderer's **Elemental Skill**. The buffs include the following:
  * If **Hydro** is **Swirled**, Wanderer gains more initial resources upon entering his **Elemental Skill**.&#x20;
  * If **Pyro** is **Swirled**, Wanderer gains an **ATK%** buff.&#x20;
  * If **Cryo** is **Swirled**, Wanderer gains a **CRIT Rate** buff.&#x20;
  * If **Electro** is **Swirled**, Wanderer will gain energy when attacking with his **Normal** and **Charged Attacks**.
* **A4** gives Wanderer's **Normal** and **Charged** **Attacks** (whilst in the state activated by his **Elemental Skill**) **** a chance to activate a buff. This buff removes the resource cost associated with the next usage of his aerial dash and causes it to fire off four arrows dealing **Anemo** **Damage** when cast.

## Additional Notes

* Wanderer is amazing for general exploration as **Stamina** will recover while Wanderer is using his **Elemental Skill.**
* **C1** buffs Wanderer's **Attack SPD** whilst in the state activated by his **Elemental Skill** and increases the damage dealt by his **A4** passive.
* **C2** increases the damage dealt by Wanderer's **Elemental Burst** based on how little of his resource remains when it is cast.
* **C4** increases the maximum number of buffs obtained from Wanderer's **A1** from two to three. If two or fewer buffs are obtained, Wanderer will randomly obtain a buff from an element that he does not currently have.
* **C6** causes Wanderer's **Normal Attacks** (whilst in the state activated by his **Elemental Skill**) to deal an additional instance of damage and restore a bit of his resource up to a maximum of five times per **Elemental Skill**.

## Works Well With

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_faruzan.png)

* Wanderer mainly deals **Anemo Damage**, and Faruzan's ability to debuff **Anemo RES** and buff the damage of **Anemo** **Normal** and **Charged Attacks** synergizes extremely well with Wanderer.

* Yunjin, similarly to Faruzan, can buff Wanderer's **Normal** and **Charged** **Attacks**.

* Characters that can deal sustained damage Off-Field (ideally without too much external support) work well with Wanderer due to characters not being able to switch in while he is airborne.

## Does Not Work Well With

* As a Main DPS himself, Wanderer does not want to paired with other Main DPS's.
* Wanderer can't easily deal **Physical Damage** and so should not be paired with Physical damage characters.

## Teams

**Anemo**

* Wanderer deals large amounts of **Anemo Damage**, supported by Faruzan and Bennett's various buffs.
* Faruzan both buffs Wanderer and can help generate **Anemo Particles** for Wanderer's **Elemental Burst.**
* Xingqiu deals **Hydro Damage** from Off-Field.
* Bennett acts as a healer and can buff Wanderer's **ATK.**
