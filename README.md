# Introduction

This is a guide to building your team in Genshin Impact.

If you're new to Genshin Impact, it's a good idea to take a look at the **Roles** a character can have. These **Roles** are used across the Genshin Helper Team guides including the builds guide located [here](https://tinyurl.com/genshinbuilds) and the Spiral Abyss Guide located [here](https://genshinhelper.gitbook.io/abyss/).

Otherwise, feel free to take a look at the **Characters** pages listed on the sidebar which give a rough summary of the character's strengths and weaknesses as well as list other characters that work well with them and teams they can be used in.

A list of common **Teams** used in Genshin Impact is also listed to the left and lists options from best to worst when building that particular team.
