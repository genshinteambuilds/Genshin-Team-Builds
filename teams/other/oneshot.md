# Oneshot

This game plan focuses on dealing a large amount of burst damage to enemies \(ideally ending the encounter immediately\) without caring much about repeatability and follow up damage. This is usually accomplished by utilizing hydro or pyro characters with a large single hit burst, notably, Hutao, Childe, and Mona in combination with their respective 2x reaction \(Hutao has a slight caveat which will be discussed later\), which is melt for Hutao and vaporise for Childe and Mona. The other character slots are used to apply the element being reacted with, as well as to provide damage increases to the main damage dealer. Skill usage order and character order is very important in these types of compositions. This style of play also benefits heavily from the Elemental Mastery stat and often have different artifacts and weapon choices than traditional play, and setups vary widely by availability of characters and equipment. Note that the damage you get out of a setup is extremely dependent upon your character’s artifact stats, supporting character’s stats, constellations, and weapons. Eula, a relatively new addition, works in a slightly different way than the other three, as she simply relies on her burst’s extremely high damage scaling to accomplish this task.

## **A Brief Overview of Terminology**

 **Main carry** - The character whose ability is responsible for the lion’s share of damage.

 **Enabler** - The character that is responsible for applying the opposite element for the main carry to react with

 **For the mobile gamers:** AA refers to character’s Auto Attack, E refers to a character’s skill, Q is their burst

## **Main Carry: Hutao**

**Primary enablers used**

            She can also function as a damage amplifier alongside a cryo enabler, as
