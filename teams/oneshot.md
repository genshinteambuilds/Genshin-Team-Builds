# Oneshot

These team compositions focus on dealing a large amount of burst damage to enemies (ideally ending the encounter immediately) without caring much about repeatability and follow up damage. This is usually accomplished by utilizing characters with very high Elemental Burst modifiers that can take full advantage of multiple scaling, Buffs, and/or Elemental Reactions. Notable Elemental Reactions are Melt and Vaporize as they are able to provide an additional final multiplier to Damage. The other character slots are used mainly to "setup" the Oneshot and stack multiple buffs and apply Elements in a specific order.

Elemental Skill and Burst usage order and character swapping order is very important in these types of compositions. This playstyle will often have different artifacts and weapon choices than traditional play, and setups vary widely by availability of characters and equipment.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: The teams shown on this page are only a few examples and not an exhaustive list by any means. The core concept of every Oneshot team is the same: activate all of your buffs and debuffs and set up Elements onto the enemy so that the Main Carry is able to maximize their burst damage. The damage you get out of a setup is extremely dependent upon your character’s artifact stats, supporting character’s stats, constellations, and weapons.

## **A Brief Overview of Terminology**

**Main Carry** - The character whose ability is responsible for the one shot.

**Enablers** - The characters that is responsible for applying the Element for the Main Carry to react with. Only applicable for Melt/Vaporize Main Carries.

**For the mobile gamers:** AA refers to character’s Auto Attack, E refers to a character’s Elemental Skill, Q is their Elemental Burst.

## **Main Carry: Hu Tao**

**Primary Enablers used:** Ayaka, Ganyu, Mona, other Cryo

**Supporting Cast:** Bennett, Kazuha, Sucrose, Mona, Amber, Zhongli

### **Main Carry**

****![](../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Hutao.png)****

* Hu Tao is a complex character in terms of damage scaling, due to her constellations and HP scaling on her Elemental Burst as well as Staff of Homa, her signature weapon, giving even more HP scaling.
* Testing Elemental Mastery and HP timepieces to see which gives the most damage with your current setup is a must.
  * HP timepiece will generally be better for those with Staff of Homa.

### **Primary Enablers**

![](../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Ayaka.png)

* Generally the best choice at Constellation 4+. The DEF Shred (Constellation 4+) along with possible use of Freedom-Sworn make her the best choice at ultra high investment levels.

![](../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Ganyu.png)

* Able to buff damage on enemies inside her Elemental Burst at Constellation 4.
* Able to carry Elegy for the End and provide more ATK DMG and Elemental Mastery.

![](../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Mona.png)

* Although Mona is not Cryo, she is able to be used in specific scenarios (Floor 7 with Cryogunner, Blizzard Strayer Domain). If Melt is not an option, then Mona can be used as a Vaporize Enabler.
* Provides large Buffs through her Elemental Burst and ability to carry Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayer.

![](../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Kaeya.png)

* Kaeya is able to provide constant Cryo and can carry Freedom-Sworn. Use him only if no other Enablers above are available.

### **Supporting cast**

![](../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)&#x20;

* Bennett provides a large Attack Buff from his Elemental Burst and can be used for Swirling Pyro as Hu Tao has no way to apply Pyro without using her Elemental Skill or Elemental Burst.
* Hu Tao should be very low in health before switching to her so that she does not heal past the 50% threshold for her passive. If needed, Bennett can be equipped with a non-upgraded flower to lower his Healing.

![](../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Kazuha.png)

* Can be run as a 4 set Viridescent Venerer carrier and provides a large damage boost to your team based on his own Elemental Mastery and the Element that he Swirls.
* Constellation 2 grants 200 EM to everyone on the team.
* Can carry Freedom-Sworn.

![](../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Sucrose.png)

* Can be run as a 4 set Viridescent Venerer carrier and is able to transfer a flat amount of Elemental Mastery along with a portion of her own Elemental Mastery to other party members.
* Can carry Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayer.
* Aim to use her after another Element has been applied, since Swirl increases the Elemental Mastery transfer.

![](../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Mona.png)

* Mona can also function as a damage amplifier alongside a cryo enabler, as her Omen is a 5 second Debuff that grants the increased damage during that duration.
* Can carry Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayer.

![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_amber.png)

* Able to carry Elegy for the End and easily activate the passive through her Elemental Burst.
* At Constellation 6, using her Elemental Burst gives her team a small ATK% Buff.
* Used for Swirling Pyro for Viridescent Venerer's Debuff with an Anemo character.

![](../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Zhongli.png)

* Zhongli's Shield decreases all Elemental Resistance along with Stagger Resistance.

* Bennett Elemental Burst -> Kazuha Elemental Burst -> Ayaka Elemental Burst -> Hu Tao Elemental Skill -> Hu Tao Elemental Burst

![](../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Hutao.png)![](../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Kaeya.png)![](../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)![](../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Sucrose.png)

* Bennett Elemental Burst -> Sucrose Elemental Skill -> Kaeya Elemental Skill -> Kaeya Elemental Burst -> Hu Tao Elemental Skill -> Hu Tao Elemental Burst

## **Main Carry: Mona**

**Primary Enablers used:** Bennett, Klee, any Pyro.

**Supporting Cast:** Sucrose, Kazuha, any Anemo (for the resistance shred)

### Main Carry

![](../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Mona.png)

* Mona has a very high multiplier on her Elemental Burst that benefits from the Omen damage bonus that it provides. A Vaporized Mona' Elemental Burst has one of the highest damage ceilings in the game.&#x20;
* Mona's Elemental Burst has an interesting mechanic where the initial cast applies Hydro and the damage only occurs after another instance of damage triggers her "bubble" to pop. Due to how Internal Cooldown of elemental application works, there needs to be at least 2.5 seconds between the initial Hydro application on cast and when the bubble breaks so that it is able to apply Hydro and Vaporize.

### **Primary Enablers**

![](../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)&#x20;

* Bennett applies Pyro and his elemental burst buffs Mona’s ATK based on his base atk (weapon atk + character atk). There’s too much value in Bennett to not utilize him.

![](../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Klee.png)![](../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Yanfei.png)![](../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Pyro.webp)

* Klee and Yanfei helps at applying Pyro and using an R5 Thrilling tales of Dragon Slayers which buffs your Mona with 48% atk and if you Klee's have her C2, her Elemental Skill shreds the enemy's DEF by 23%, which helps a lot to deal even more damage. If you don’t have Klee or Yanfei, any Pyro works.

### Supporting Cast

![](../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Sucrose.png)

* Can be run as a 4 set Viridescent Venerer carrier and is able to transfer a flat amount of Elemental Mastery along with a portion of her own Elemental Mastery to other party members.
* Can carry Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayer.
* Aim to use her after another Element has been applied, since Swirl increases the Elemental Mastery transfer.

![](../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Kazuha.png)

* Can be run as a 4 set Viridescent Venerer carrier and provides a large damage boost to your team based on his own Elemental Mastery and the Element that he Swirls.
* Constellation 2 grants 200 EM to everyone on the team.
* Can carry Freedom-Sworn.

### Mona Vaporize Setup

**Step 1**: Apply Hydro with Mona’s Normal Attack

**Step 2**: Swirl with Sucrose’s skill (to decrease Hydro resistance by 40% with 4 set Viridescent Venerer’s effect)

**Step 3**: Use Bennett's skill to completely remove Hydro aura on enemies after swirling with sucrose (some Hydro aura still linger on the enemy, this is just to make sure that Step 4 won’t trigger any vaporize reactions from Bennett)

**Step 4**: Use Bennett's Burst to buff up your Mona while also applying Pyro aura to the enemy

**Step 5**: Use Mona's Burst and wait for roughly 2 seconds before swapping (there’s ICD\*/ Internal Cool Down on Mona’s burst, and you need to wait before swapping so that when you swap to Bennett, Mona will still gain the ATK buffs given by Bennett’s burst (it lingers for a while))

**Step 6**: Use Bennett's skill or apply any Pyro to “pop” the bubble

_Step 1 & Step 2_ are skippable but it does boost your burst damage by a lot since it shreds 40% Hydro resistance.

**\*ICD/ Internal CoolDown**

For ICDs, it’s a concept so that a skill cannot do the same elemental reactions right after it has just caused one. This means you cannot trigger Vaporize from the same source right after triggering one. Mona’s initial burst on enemies affected with Pyro aura acts as a Vaporize reaction, and you must wait for about 2 seconds to apply another instance of Pyro so that her burst is vaporized properly.

### Sample Mona Teams

![](../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Mona.png)![](../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)![](../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Klee.png)![](../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Sucrose.png)

* Mona Normal Attack -> Sucrose Elemental Skill -> Bennett Elemental Skill -> Bennett Elemental Burst -> Klee skill (if C2) if not Normal Attack is fine -> Mona Elemental Burst -> wait 2 seconds for ICD before swapping -> Bennett Elemental Skill

## **Main Carry:** Tartaglia / Childe

**Primary Enablers used:** Bennett, Amber, Xiangling, other Pyro

**Supporting Cast:** Kazuha, Sucrose, other Anemo, Zhongli

### **Main Carry**

****![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_tartaglia.png)****

* Tartaglia has two ways to use his Elemental Burst, based on which form he is in. Bow form does less damage but occurs much faster since it returns 20 energy back to Tartaglia, while Melee form requires the transformation and does much more damage.&#x20;
* Tartaglia Oneshot teams will focus on Vaporizing the Melee form Elemental Burst.

### Primary Enablers

![](../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)

* Bennett** **provides a massive ATK buff and is able to set up by applying Pyro.

![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_amber.png)

* Provides large buffs through her Elemental Burst and ability to carry Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayer.
* C1 and C4 improve the party's Vaporize damage and Crit Rate during the rotation.

* Can carry Freedom-Sworn.

![](../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Zhongli.png)

* Mona Elemental Burst -> Sucrose E -> Bennett Elemental Burst -> Tartaglia E (don't hit enemy with activation damage) -> Tartaglia Elemental Burst

![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_tartaglia.png)![](../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)![](../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xiangling.png)![](../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Kazuha.png)

* Tartaglia Elemental Skill (apply Hydro on enemy) -> Bennett Elemental Burst (do not clear the Hydro application) -> Kazuha Elemental Burst (inside Bennett Elemental Burst) -> Xiangling Elemental Burst -> Tartaglia Elemental Skill -> Tartaglia Elemental Burst

![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_tartaglia.png)![](../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)![](../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Sucrose.png)![](../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Zhongli.png)

* Zhongli hold Elemental Skill -> Tartaglia Charged Aimed Shot -> Sucrose Elemental Skill -> Bennett Elemental Burst -> Tartaglia Elemental Skill (don't hit enemy with activation damage) -> Tartaglia Elemental Burst

## **Main Carry: Eula**

**Enabler: **Lisa, Raiden

**Supporting Cast:** Bennett, Zhongli, Xinyan

### Main Carry

![](../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Eula.png)

* Eula’s Elemental Burst is the centerpiece to this team. It does a fair amount of damage on cast, but Eula Oneshot teams will be focused on the explosion at the end as well as maximizing stack count.&#x20;
* The final explosion does Physical Damage and switching characters will cause Eula's Elemental Burst to detonate shortly after, leaving some options for last second buffs/debuffs to apply.&#x20;

### Primary Enablers

![](../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Lisa.png)

* Lisa is the the best choice as an Enabler for Eula.&#x20;
* Provides Superconduct and DEF shred through her Elemental Burst.
* Can carry Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayer.

![](../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Shougun.png)

* Provides Superconduct and Elemental Burst damage buff.

### Supporting Cast

![](../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)

* Provides a massive ATK buff that lasts long enough for Eula's entire Elemental Burst duration.

![](../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Zhongli.png)

* Zhongli's Shield decreases all Elemental Resistance along with Stagger Resistance. The Stagger Resistance is valuable on Eula for her to be able to build stacks uninterrupted.

![](../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xinyan.png)

* Provides Physical Damage buffs/debuffs through A4 and C4.
* Can carry Wolf's Gravestone.

### Sample Eula Teams

![](../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Eula.png)![](../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Lisa.png)![](../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Bennett.png)![](../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Xinyan.png)

* Eula Elemental Skill -> Bennett Elemental Burst -> Lisa Elemental Burst -> Eula Elemental Burst  -> Eula Normal Attack x 4 -> Eula Elemental Skill -> Eula Normal Attack x 4 -> Xinyan Elemental Skill
* Utilizes Pyro Resonance and Lisa's DEF shred to provide high amounts of buffs and debuffs for Eula.&#x20;
* Xinyan can increase Eula's damage significantly if she is able to proc Wolf's Gravestone's passive with her Elemental Skill.&#x20;
* Note: Bennett's Elemental Burst will barely last long enough for this rotation. Make sure to utilize the quick Elemental Burst commands (ALT + #) when using this rotation.

## **Main Carry: Ayaka**

**Supporting Cast:** Mona, Kazuha, Bennett, Ganyu, other Anemo, Zhongli

### Main Carry

![](../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Ayaka.png)

* Ayaka's Elemental Burst has one of the highest multipliers in the game, making her one of the best characters to utilize for Oneshot compositions.&#x20;
* While most Cryo Oneshot teams would focus on Melting the damage, Ayaka's Elemental Burst damage is spread across many smaller hits making Melt less viable than going for traditional Freeze to focus on high Crit Damage and other buffs/debuffs.&#x20;

### Supporting Cast

![](../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Mona.png)

* Provides large Buffs through her Elemental Burst and ability to carry Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayer.

## **Main Carry: Raiden**

**Supporting Cast:** Sara (C6), Kazuha, Bennett, other Anemo, Mona, Zhongli

### Main Carry

![](../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Shougun.png)

* Raiden Shogun has the highest Electro single damage instance multiplier in the game currently with her Elemental Burst's initial slash. This doesn't even count the damage from attacks that comes after.
