# Oneshot

These team compositions focus on dealing a large amount of burst damage to enemies (ideally ending the encounter immediately) without caring much about repeatability and follow up damage. This is usually accomplished by utilizing characters with very high **Elemental Burst** modifiers that can take full advantage of multiple scaling, buffs, and/or **Elemental Reactions**. Notable **Elemental Reactions** are **Melt** and **Vaporize** as they are able to provide an additional final multiplier to damage. The other character slots are used mainly to "setup" the Oneshot and stack multiple buffs and apply **Elements** in a specific order.

**Elemental Skill** and **Burst** usage order and character swapping order is very important in these types of compositions. This playstyle will often have different artifacts and weapon choices than traditional play, and setups vary widely by availability of characters and equipment.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: The teams shown on this page are only a few examples and not an exhaustive list by any means. The core concept of every Oneshot team is the same: activate all of your buffs and debuffs and set up Elements onto the enemy so that the Main Carry is able to maximize their burst damage. The damage you get out of a setup is extremely dependent upon your character’s artifact stats, supporting character’s stats, constellations, and weapons.
{% endhint %}

## **A Brief Overview of Terminology**

**Main Carry** - The character whose ability is responsible for the one shot.

**Enablers** - The characters that is responsible for applying the **Element** for the Main Carry to react with. Only applicable for **Melt**/**Vaporize** Main Carries.

**For the mobile gamers:** N refers to character’s **Normal Attack**, C refers to character's **Charged Attack**, E refers to a character’s **Elemental Skill**, Q is their **Elemental Burst**.

## **Main Carry: Hu Tao**

**Primary Enablers used:** Ayaka, Ganyu, Mona, other Cryo

**Supporting Cast:** Bennett, Kazuha, Sucrose, Mona, Amber, Zhongli

### **Main Carry**

#### ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_hutao.png)

* Hu Tao is a complex character in terms of damage scaling, due to her constellations and **HP** scaling on her **Elemental Burst** as well as **Staff of Homa**, her signature weapon, giving even more **HP** scaling.
* Testing **Elemental Mastery** and **HP** Sands to see which gives the most damage with your current setup is a must.
  * **HP** Sands will generally be better for those with **Staff of Homa**.

### **Primary Enablers**

#### ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_ayaka.png)

* Generally the best choice at **C4**+. The **DEF Shred** (**C4**+) along with possible use of **Freedom-Sworn** make her the best choice at ultra high investment levels.

#### ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_ganyu.png)

* Able to buff **DMG** dealt to enemies inside her **Elemental Burst** at **C4**.
* Able to carry **Elegy for the End** and provide more **ATK** and **Elemental Mastery**.

#### ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_mona.png)

* Although Mona is not **Cryo**, she is able to be used in specific scenarios (**Floor 7** with Cryogunner, **Blizzard Strayer** Domain). If Melt is not an option, then Mona can be used as a Vaporize Enabler.
* Provides large buffs through her **Elemental Burst** and ability to carry **Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayer**.

#### ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_kaeya.png)

* Kaeya is able to provide constant **Cryo** and can carry Freedom-Sworn. Use him only if no other Enablers above are available.

### **Supporting cast**

#### ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_bennett.png)

* Bennett provides a large **ATK** buff from his **Elemental Burst** and can be used for Swirling **Pyro** as Hu Tao has no way to apply Pyro without using her **Elemental Skill** or **Elemental Burst**.
* Hu Tao should be very low in health before switching to her so that she does not heal past the 50% threshold for her passive. If needed, Bennett can be equipped with a non-upgraded flower to lower his healing.

#### ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_kazuha.png)

* Can be run as a 4 set **Viridescent Venerer** carrier and provides a large **Elemental** **DMG** buff to your team based on his own **Elemental Mastery** and the Element that he **Swirls**.
* **C2** grants 200 **Elemental Mastery** to everyone on the team.
* Can carry **Freedom-Sworn**.

#### ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_sucrose.png)

* Can be run as a 4 set **Viridescent Venerer** carrier and is able to transfer a flat amount of **Elemental Mastery** along with a portion of her own **Elemental Mastery** to other party members.
* Can carry **Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayer**.
* Aim to use her after another **Element** has been applied, since **Swirl** increases the **Elemental Mastery** transfer.

#### ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_mona.png)

* Mona can also function as a damage amplifier alongside a **Cryo** enabler, as her Omen is a 5 second debuff that provides a **DMG Bonus** to all attacks during that duration.
* Can carry **Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayer**.

#### ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_amber.png)

* Able to carry **Elegy for the End** and easily activate the passive through her **Elemental Burst**.
* At **C6**, using her **Elemental Burst** gives her team a small **ATK**% buff.
* Used for **Swirling Pyro** for **Viridescent Venerer**'s debuff with an **Anemo** character.

#### ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_zhongli.png)

* Zhongli's shield decreases all enemy **Elemental RES**.

* `Bennett Q -> Sucrose E -> Kaeya E -> Kaeya Q -> Hu Tao E -> Hu Tao Q`

## **Main Carry: Mona**

**Primary Enablers used:** Bennett, Klee, any Pyro.

**Supporting Cast:** Sucrose, Kazuha, any Anemo (for the **RES** shred)

### Main Carry

#### ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_mona.png)

* Mona has a very high multiplier on her **Elemental Burst** that benefits from the Omen **DMG Bonus** that it provides. A **Vaporized** Mona' **Elemental Burst** has one of the highest damage ceilings in the game.
* Mona's **Elemental Burst** has an interesting mechanic where the initial cast applies **Hydro** and the damage only occurs after another instance of damage triggers her "bubble" to pop. Due to how Internal Cooldown of elemental application works, there needs to be at least 2.5 seconds between the initial **Hydro** application on cast and when the bubble breaks so that it is able to apply **Hydro** and **Vaporize**.

### **Primary Enablers**

#### ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_bennett.png)

* Bennett applies **Pyro** and his **Elemental Burst** buffs Mona’s **ATK** based on his base **ATK** (Weapon **ATK** + Character **ATK**). There’s too much value in Bennett to not utilize him.

#### ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_klee.png) ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_yanfei.png) ![](../.gitbook/assets/Element\_Pyro.webp)

* Klee and Yanfei help at applying **Pyro** and using an R5 **Thrilling tales of Dragon Slayers** which buffs your Mona's **ATK** by 48%. If you Klee's **C2**, her **Elemental Skill** shreds the enemy's **DEF** by 23%, which helps a lot to deal even more damage. If you don’t have Klee or Yanfei, any **Pyro** works.

### Supporting Cast

#### ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_sucrose.png)

* Can be run as a 4 set **Viridescent Venerer** carrier and is able to transfer a flat amount of **Elemental Mastery** along with a portion of her own **Elemental Mastery** to other party members.
* Can carry **Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayer**.
* Aim to use her after another **Element** has been applied, since **Swirl** increases the **Elemental Mastery** transfer.

#### ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_kazuha.png)

* Can be run as a 4 set **Viridescent Venerer** carrier and provides a large **DMG** boost to your team based on his own **Elemental Mastery** and the **Element** that he Swirls.
* **C2** grants 200 **Elemental Mastery** to everyone on the team.
* Can carry **Freedom-Sworn**.

### Mona Vaporize Setup

**Step 1**: Apply **Hydro** with Mona’s **Normal Attack**

**Step 2**: **Swirl** with Sucrose’s **Elemental** **Skill** (to decrease **Hydro RES** by 40% with 4 set **Viridescent Venere**r’s effect)

**Step 3**: Use Bennett's **Elemental Skill** to completely remove **Hydro** aura on enemies after swirling with sucrose (some Hydro aura still linger on the enemy, this is just to make sure that Step 4 won’t trigger any **Vaporize** reactions from Bennett)

**Step 4**: Use Bennett's **Elemental Burst** to buff up your Mona while also applying **Pyro** aura to the enemy

**Step 5**: Use Mona's **Elemental Burst** and wait for roughly 2 seconds before swapping (there’s ICD\*/ Internal Cool Down on Mona’s **Elemental Burst**, and you need to wait before swapping so that when you swap to Bennett, Mona will still gain the **ATK** buffs given by Bennett’s burst (it lingers for one second))

**Step 6**: Use Bennett's **Elemental Skill** or apply any **Pyro** to “pop” the bubble

_Step 1 & Step 2_ are skippable but it does boost your burst damage by a lot since it shreds 40% **Hydro RES**.

**\*ICD / Internal Cooldown**

For ICDs, it’s a concept so that a skill cannot do the same **elemental reactions** right after it has just caused one. This means you cannot trigger **Vaporize** from the same source right after triggering one. Mona’s initial **burst** on enemies affected with **Pyro** aura acts as a **Vaporize** reaction, and you must wait for about 2 seconds to apply another instance of **Pyro** so that her burst is vaporized properly.

### Sample Mona Teams

#### ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_mona.png)![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_klee.png)![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_sucrose.png)![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_bennett.png)

* `Mona N → Sucrose E → Bennett E → Bennett Q → Klee E (if C2) if not N is fine → Mona Q → wait 2 seconds for ICD before swapping → Bennett E`

## **Main Carry:** Tartaglia / Childe

**Primary Enablers used:** Bennett, Amber, Xiangling, other Pyro

**Supporting Cast:** Kazuha, Sucrose, other Anemo, Zhongli

### **Main Carry**

#### ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_tartaglia.png)

* Tartaglia has two ways to use his **Elemental Burst**, based on which form he is in. **Ranged stance** (rQ) does less damage but occurs much faster since it returns 20 energy back to Tartaglia, while **Melee stance** (mQ) requires the transformation and does much more damage.
* Tartaglia Oneshot teams will focus on **Vaporizing** the **Melee Stance Elemental Burst**.

### Primary Enablers

#### ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_bennett.png)

* Bennett provides a massive **ATK** buff and is able to set up by applying **Pyro**.

#### ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_amber.png)

* Amber provides very quick **Pyro** application at a range.
* Can activate **Elegy for the End** and further buff with **C6**.

#### ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_xiangling.png)

* Xiangling is a solid choice for certain setups. She provides much needed Off-Field **Pyro** application, as well as quite a lot of personal damage.

### Supporting Cast

#### ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_mona.png)

* Provides large buffs through her **Elemental Burst** and ability to carry **Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayer**.
* **C1** and **C4** improve the party's **Vaporize** damage and **CRIT Rate** during the rotation.

#### ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_sucrose.png)

* Can be run as a 4 set **Viridescent Venerer** carrier and is able to transfer a flat amount of **Elemental Mastery** along with a portion of her own **Elemental Mastery** to other party members.
* Can carry **Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayer**.
* Aim to use her after another **Element** has been applied, since **Swirl** increases the **Elemental Mastery** transfer.

#### ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_kazuha.png)

* Can be run as a 4 set **Viridescent Venerer** carrier and provides a large **DMG Bonus** to your team based on his own Elemental Mastery and the Element that he Swirls.
* **C2** grants 200 **Elemental Mastery** to everyone on the team.
* Can carry **Freedom-Sworn**.

#### ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_zhongli.png)

* Zhongli's Shield decreases all **Elemental RES** along with resistance to interruption.

### Sample Childe Teams

## **Main Carry: Eula**

**Enabler:** Lisa, Raiden

**Supporting Cast:** Bennett, Zhongli, Xinyan

### Main Carry

#### ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_eula.png)

* Eula’s **Elemental Burst** is the centerpiece to this team. It does a fair amount of damage on cast, but Eula Oneshot teams will be focused on the explosion at the end as well as maximizing stack count.
* The final explosion does **Physical DMG** and switching characters will cause Eula's **Elemental Burst** to detonate shortly after, leaving some options for last second buffs/debuffs to apply.

### Primary Enablers

#### ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_lisa.png)

* Lisa is the the best choice as an Enabler for Eula.
* Provides **Superconduct** and **DEF shred** through her **Elemental Burst**.
* Can carry **Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayer**.

#### ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_raiden\_shougun.png)

* Provides **Superconduct** and **Elemental Burst** **DMG** buff.

### Supporting Cast

#### ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_bennett.png)

* Provides a massive **ATK** buff that lasts long enough for Eula's entire **Elemental Burst** duration.

#### ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_zhongli.png)

* Zhongli's Shield decreases all **Elemental RES** along with resistance to interruption. The resistance to interruption is valuable on Eula for her to be able to build stacks uninterrupted.

#### ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_xinyan.png)

* Provides **Physical DMG** buffs/debuffs through **A4** and **C4**.
* Can carry **Wolf's Gravestone**.

### Sample Eula Teams

#### ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_eula.png) ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_lisa.png) ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_xinyan.png) ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_bennett.png)

* `Eula E -> Bennett Q → Lisa Q → Eula Q → Eula N x 4→ Eula hold E → Eula N x 4 → Xinyan E`
* Utilizes **Pyro Resonance** and Lisa's **DEF** shred to provide high amounts of buffs and debuffs for Eula.
* Xinyan can increase Eula's damage significantly if she is able to proc **Wolf's Gravestone's** passive with her **Elemental Skill**.
* Note: Bennett's **Elemental Burst** will barely last long enough for this rotation. Make sure to utilize the quick **Elemental Burst** commands (ALT + #) when using this rotation.

## **Main Carry: Ayaka**

**Supporting Cast:** Mona, Kazuha, Bennett, Ganyu, other Anemo, Zhongli

### Main Carry

#### ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_ayaka.png)

* Ayaka's **Elemental Burst** has one of the highest multipliers in the game, making her one of the best characters to utilize for Oneshot compositions.
* While most **Cryo** Oneshot teams would focus on **Melting** the damage, Ayaka's **Elemental Burst DMG** is spread across many smaller hits making **Melt** less viable than going for traditional **Freeze** to focus on high **CRIT DMG** and other buffs/debuffs.

### Supporting Cast

#### ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_mona.png)

* Provides large buffs through her **Elemental Burst** and ability to carry **Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayer**.

#### ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_kazuha.png)

* Can be run as a 4 set **Viridescent Venerer** carrier and provides a large **DMG Bonus** to your team based on his own **Elemental Mastery** and the **Element** that he **Swirls**.
* Can carry **Freedom-Sworn**.
* Can be swapped out for other **Anemo** characters like Sucrose or Venti.

#### ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_bennett.png)

## **Main Carry: Raiden**

**Supporting Cast:** Sara (C6), Kazuha, Bennett, other Anemo, Mona, Zhongli

### Main Carry

#### ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_raiden\_shougun.png)

* Raiden Shogun has the highest **Electro** single damage instance multiplier in the game currently with her **Elemental Burst**'s initial slash. This doesn't even count the damage from attacks that comes after.
* Raiden Oneshot teams focus mostly on the **Elemental Burst**'s initial slash damage to oneshot the enemy or the wave instantly.

### Supporting Cast
