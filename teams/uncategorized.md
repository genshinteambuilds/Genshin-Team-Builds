These team compositions do not follow a normal team setup that is recommended for most players as they can either have multiple Main DPS characters or none at all and they have tested and proven to work as a viable teams to use. Some teams require a certain amount of investment to be able to deal sufficient damage and can be more expensive to build compared to the more traditional teams.

**Elemental Skill** and **Burst** usage order and character swapping order is very important in these types of compositions. This playstyle will often have different artifacts and weapon choices than traditional play, and setups vary widely by availability of characters and equipment.\


{% hint style="info" %}
The teams shown on this page are only a few examples and not an exhaustive list by any means. The damage you get out of a setup is extremely dependent upon your character’s artifact stats, supporting character’s stats, constellations, and weapons.
{% endhint %}

## **A Brief Overview of Terminology**

**Core Member/s** - Characters that are integral to make a team work and isn't recommended to be replaced with any other alternatives.

**Flex** - Characters that aren't essential for a team but can help with either buffing the core members, debuffing enemies, or just added damage.

**Support** - Refers to characters that are usually Off-Field, that buff allied characters, heal or shield the team, or debuffs enemies. See [Support](../roles/support/). This term can also simply refer to [Off-Field DPS](../roles/off-field-dps.md) as well.

**Enablers** - The characters that is responsible for applying the **Element** for the Main DPS to react with.

## **Sunfire Jean**

**Core:** Jean, Bennett

**Supporting Cast:** Raiden, Ganyu, Xinqgiu, Fischl, Xiangling

\
This team has Jean and Bennett paired together because of how their **Elemental Bursts** work as they both apply their elements on the current On-Field character. This can synergize as just by being inside AoE of their bursts they trigger swirl reactions which applies **Pyro** on enemies allowing for consistent **Elemental Reactions** and is effective against elemental shields.

### **Core Members**

#### Jean - Support/Enabler

![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_jean.png)

* Jean's main role is to cast her **Elemental Burst** which applies Anemo on your current character and when used alongside Bennett's **Elemental Burst** this triggers Swirl reactions which deals damage to enemies.
* Jean generally needs to use the **Viridescent Venerer** 4-set to reduce **Pyro** resistance when triggering a reaction with Bennett.
  * The damage from the Swirls scales on Jean's **Elemental Mastery** so focusing her stats on it allows Jean to gain a deal sufficient damage with minimal investment.
* Having high **Energy Recharge** allows Jean to consistently cast her **Elemental Burst** and as such it is recommended to either use an **Energy Recharge** Sands or Weapon.

#### Bennett: Support

![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_bennett.png)

* Bennett provides an **ATK** buff and can also apply **Pyro** on your current On-Field character with his **Elemental Burst** which allows Jean to **Swirl** with her **Elemental Burst.**&#x20;
* If there is another Pyro character present on the team he is able to provide **Pyro Energy Particles** to recharge their **Elemental Bursts** faster.

### **Supporting Cast**

**Raiden: Main DPS/Support**

****![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_shougun.png)****

* Raiden Shogun can plays a role of both a Main DPS and a Support as she can deal damage as well as provide energy to the entire team with her **Elemental Burst.** This can allow other members in the party to focus less on building **Energy Recharge** and more on damage.

**Ganyu: Main DPS**

****![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_ganyu.png)****

* Ganyu can work in a Sunfire Jean team because of the frequent **Pyro** application with the **Swirl** reaction from Jean and Bennett's **Elemental Burst**. This allows Ganyu to consistently trigger **Melt** reactions with her Charged shots.

#### Xingqiu: Off-Field DPS/Enabler

![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_xingqiu.png)

* Xingqiu's **Elemental Burst** can apply **Hydro** on enemies which can trigger Vaporize and/or Electro-charged reactions.
  * It is recommended to have **Sacrificial Sword** or any sword with **Energy Recharge** to consistently have his **Elemental Burst** ready on cooldown.

**Fischl: Off-field DPS**

![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_fischl.png)

* Fischl can deal Off-field damage with her **Elemental Skill** and can provide **Energy** **Particles** for the entire team.
* She also applies **Electro** on enemies to trigger **Electro-charged** and/or **Overload** reactions.

**Xiangling: Off-field DPS/Enabler**

![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_xiangling.png)

* Xiangling is only a viable option in a Sunfire Jean team if she is paired with Ganyu.
* She alternate on applying **Pyro** with Jean and Bennett's **Elemental Burst** synergy during their downtime.

### **Sample Sunfire Jean Teams**

## Raiden Dual Carry&#x20;

**Core**: **** Raiden, another carry that wants energy (commonly Xiao)\


The idea of this team is to have Raiden buff the team, mainly of their **Elemental Burst DMG** as well as providing a limited amount of energy to aid the team with their needs, thereby lowering the **Energy Recharge** for the whole team which makes room for more offensive stats on everyone. Another advantage is the team mitigates disadvantages against phased bosses, multi enemy wave content, and low energy scenarios.

The disadvantage of the team is that it does not maximize all the skill and burst by having them casted off cooldown and extends the total rotation time due to both carries requiring their time on field to shine (somewhat mitigated by Raiden's good personal raw **DMG**). Overall it's only a slight DPS increase comparing to well designed traditional teams and is expensive to build when compared to other Energy Battery options.&#x20;

### **Core Members**

**Raiden: Main DPS/Support**

​![](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-MgIuSiDFSNyVZCB3uMq%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-a6081b271595da94b37bd225a927dc71cee2f259%2FUI\_AvatarIcon\_Shougun.png?alt=media)**​**

* Raiden Shogun can plays a role of both a Main DPS and a Support as she can deal damage as well as provide energy to the entire team with her **Elemental Burst.** This can allow other members in the party to focus less on building **Energy Recharge** and more on damage.

**Xiao: Main DPS**

​![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_xiao.png)**​**

* The most common partner in a Raiden dual carry team. While Xiao does not benefit from the **Elemental Burst DMG** buff from Raiden, her skill lasts the whole duration of Xiao's **Elemental Burst** and the energy provided by Raiden allows Xiao to replace an Energy Battery with her.&#x20;

**Ayato: Main DPS**

![](../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Ayato.png)

* Raiden's ability to provide energy eases Ayato's struggles to gain energy back for his high cost **Elemental Burst**.&#x20;

## Hydro Freeze

**Core:** A **Hydro** Main DPS such as Tartaglia or Kokomi

**Supporting Cast:** Kaeya, Rosaria, **Anemo** Supports



This team functions in nearly the same way as [**Freeze (Cryo)**](freeze.md) teams, except **Hydro** application is provided by the Main DPS and **Cryo** application is provided from Off-Field DPS. Due to the fact that the **Hydro** Main DPS currently available in the game offer less damage than their **Cryo** counterparts, this team relies more on Off-Field DPS to kill enemies.

### Core Members

**Kokomi: Main DPS/Healer**

****![](../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Kokomi.png)****

* Kokomi plays the role of both Healer and Main DPS in this team, providing **Hydro** application with her **Elemental Skill** and **Normal Attacks** and healing with her **Elemental Skill**.

**Tartaglia: Main DPS**

****![](../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Tartaglia.png)****

* Tartaglia provides **Hydro** damage with his **Normal** and **Charged Attacks** while his **Elemental Skill** is active. Due to the long cooldown of his **Elemental Skill**, teams using Tartaglia as the sole source of **Hydro** application may struggle keeping enemies frozen.

### Supporting Cast

**Kaeya: Off-Field DPS**

****![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_kaeya.png)****

* Kaeya provides Off-Field **Cryo** damage with his **Elemental Burst** and acts as an Energy Battery using his **Elemental Skill**.

**Rosaria: Off-Field DPS**

****![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_rosaria.png)****

* Rosaria provides Off-Field **Cryo** damage with his **Elemental Burst** and provides additional energy generation with her **Elemental Skill**.

**Ganyu: Off-Field DPS**

****![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_ganyu.png)****

* Ganyu can be used as an alternative **Cryo** Off-Field DPS with her **Elemental Burst** if enough energy can be generated to allow her to consistently use it.

**Kazuha: Support**

****![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_kazuha.png)****

* Kazuha provides Grouping Crowd Control with his **Elemental Skill** and buffs **Elemental Damage** for other party members. He also provides **Elemental Resistance** debuffing using the **Viridescent Venerer** artifact set.

**Jean: Support**

****![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_jean.png)****

* Jean provides healing and **Elemental Resistance** debuffing using the **Viridescent Venerer** artifact set. Jean's primary use is in teams where additional healing is needed instead of the superior Crowd Control abilities of other **Anemo** characters.

## Bennett/Chongyun Melt

**Core:** Bennett **** (Non-**C6**) and Chongyun

**Supporting Cast:** Xingqiu, Mona, Kokomi, Diona, **Anemo** Supports\
\
This team is mainly a **Melt** (**Pyro**) comp that focuses on **Melting** Bennett's **Elemental Skill**. The main source of **Cryo** in this comp is Bennett's **Normal Attacks** infused with the **Cryo** infusion granted from Chongyun's **Elemental Skill**. **Hydro** supports are generally run in order to quickly remove **Pyro** auras from the enemy, allowing for more consistent **Melt** reactions.

### Core Members

**Bennett: Main DPS/Healer/Support**

![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_bennett.png)**​**

* Bennett's Main DPS potential comes from his **A4** talent reducing the cooldown of his **Elemental Skill** by 50% when in the field created by his **Elemental Burst**. This allows him to frequently cause damaging **Melt** reactions. Make sure to use Bennett's **Normal Attacks** to apply **Cryo** to the opponent. If Bennett is **C6** do not attempt this team; the **Pyro** infusion from Bennett's **Elemental Burst** will interefere with the **Cryo** infusion needed for consistent reactions.&#x20;

**Chongyun: Enabler**

****![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_chongyun.png)**​**

* Chongyun's main value in this team comes from the **Cryo** infusion his **Elemental Skill** grants to characters within its field. His **Elemental Burst**, if built correctly, can also be used to deal massive damage. However, Chongyun will still fulfill his role if this is not the case.

### Supporting Cast

{% hint style="info" %}
**Hydro** characters can provide Off-Field **Hydro** damage, which helps with the consistency of this team. Sometimes, enemies might still have a **Pyro** aura, and **Hydro** ensures that it will be cleared, making way for **Cryo** application and ensuring that the next instance of **Pyro** damage will **Melt**. This applies to all **Hydro** characters listed below.
{% endhint %}

**Xingqiu: Enabler/Off-Field DPS**

****![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_xingqiu.png)

* Xingqiu is recommended both for his damage and the consistency at which he applies **Hydro.**

**Mona: Enabler/Support**

****![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_mona.png)****

* The rate of Mona's **Hydro** application is relatively slow, but she can make up for this through the buffs provided by her **Elemental Burst** and her ability to carry the **Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers** catalyst.&#x20;

**Kokomi**: **Enabler/Support**

****![](../.gitbook/assets/UI\_AvatarIcon\_Kokomi.png)****

* Kokomi's **Hydro** application is good, but her utility otherwise is limited to ther ability to carry the **Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers** catalyst, as Bennett's **Elemental Burst** is often more than enough healing.

**Diona: Enabler/Support**

****![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_diona.png)****

* Diona can apply **Cryo** through her **Elemental Burst,** which aids in **Melt** uptime. At **C6,** she also provides a buff to **Elemental Mastery**, which can further increase the damage of **Melt** reactions.

**Anemo Support**

****![](../.gitbook/assets/element\_anemo.webp)****

* **Anemo** Supports, when equipped with the **Viridescent Venerer** artifact set, debuff **Elemental Resistance. Swirl Pyro** to make Bennett deal increased damage.

## **Ayaka Dual Carry**

**Core:** Ayaka, Xingqiu

**Supporting Cast:** Hu Tao, Raiden, Zhongli, Kazuha



This team utilizes Xingqiu's **Elemental Burst** to **Freeze** enemies with Ayaka's **Elemental Burst**. Another **DPS** character can be used such as Hu Tao for the remainder of Xingqiu's **Burst** duration. The advantage of this team is having up to 3 powerful elements for shield breaking.

### **Core Members**

#### **Ayaka**- Main/Burst DPS

![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_ayaka.png)

* Ayaka's role is to use **Freeze** and her **Elemental Burst** to immobilize enemies and deal large amounts of **AoE** damage.
* The 4-set **Blizzard Strayer** is a powerful option on Ayaka to maintain high **Critical Rate** during her **Elemental Burst.**
* Unless Ayaka has a **Cryo** member in her party who can help supply her **Energy,** she will require a moderate to high **Energy Recharge** (135-150%). Favonius weapons and Raiden Shogun can mitigate the requirement.

#### Xingqiu: Off-Field DPS/Enabler

![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_xingqiu.png)

* Xingqiu's **Elemental Burst** can apply **Hydro** on enemies which can trigger Freeze, Vaporize and/or Electro-charged reactions.
  * It is recommended to have **Sacrificial Sword** or any sword with **Energy Recharge** to consistently have his **Elemental Burst** ready on cooldown.
* Xingqiu's **Skill** and **Burst** provide enough **Hydro** application for both setting up **Freeze** for Ayaka's **Burst** and either Hu Tao's or Raiden Shogun's **Main DPS** rotation.

### **Supporting Cast**

**Hu Tao: Main DPS**

****![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_hutao.png)****

* Able to quickly deal large amounts of **Vaporize** or even **Melt** damage when reacting against either **** Xingqiu or Ayaka's **Bursts**
* Self-heals and doesn't require much support besides Xingqiu

**Raiden: Main DPS/Support**

****![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_shougun.png)****

* Raiden Shogun can plays a role of both a Main DPS and a Support as she can deal damage as well as provide energy to the entire team with her **Elemental Burst.** This can allow other members in the party to focus less on building **Energy Recharge** and more on damage.

**Zhongli: Shielder/Support**

****![](../.gitbook/assets/ui\_avataricon\_zhongli.png)****

* Zhongli provides a powerful **shield** which can substituted for a **Healer** since Xingqiu already provides passive healing with his rain swords.
* Reduces enemy **resistances** with Jade Shield and can buff team attack with the 4-set **Tenacity of Milleth** to all characters with high uptime and few conditions. ****&#x20;
