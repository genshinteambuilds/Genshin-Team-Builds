# Vaporize

There are no strong vaporise team compositions, due to hydro’s lack of characters that can use the reaction well. The closest two would be Childe and Mona’s one shot team compositions, which we cover in the one shot section. The Childe + Xiangling focused composition, which in actuality relies on Xiangling to reverse vaporise to do damage (we will include that team in this page as well as the Mona alternative). The last hydro character that could be used in a vaporise team is Barbara, due to her abnormally high charged attack numbers, but this is very off meta and significantly weaker than most other teams you could build around. We will still include the team here for fun.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**When running this team, make sure that Xiangling is well equipped as her burst is a large part of the team's total damage output.**
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Characters are ranked roughly according to how well they perform in this team composition.

Most of the characters within a given role are interchangeable except if mentioned above.\

## Sample Team Composition

* Cookie cutter Childe reverse-vaporize. Childe keeps enemy tagged with hydro, as well as providing some extra damage. Xiangling burst and skill activate the reverse vaporize accounting for the lions share of your damage. Kazuha is here to swirl away enemy resistances as well as provide his damage buff. Bennett keeps your Xiangling’s elemental burst charged and heals/buffs you with his burst.

*   Mona keeps enemies tagged with hydro as well as uses her burst as often as possible to keep the damage amplification uptime high. Xiangling is used for burst and skill, causing the reverse vaporize reaction and doing a lot of damage. Sucrose is there for 4 set Viridescent Venerer set as well as to transfer elemental mastery to Xiangling to increase her damage. Bennett keeps your Xiangling’s burstcharged and heals/buffs you when you use his burst.\\

* Barbara does her damage using her charged attack after an enemy is affected with pyro. Her skill and burst can be used for healing purposes, though be sure not to stand too close to the enemy so her skill does not accidentally apply hydro. Xiangling is your main source of pyro application using her skill and burst. Venti is here for 4 set Viridescent Venerer’s resistance decrease, as well as being able to supplement Xiangling’s pyro application using his tornado. Bennett is here for his buff and ability to keep Xiangling’s burst charged. The healing is a nice bonus.
