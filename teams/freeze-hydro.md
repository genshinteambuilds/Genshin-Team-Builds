# Freeze (Hydro)

The Freeze team and the **Frozen** **Elemental Reaction** require both **Cryo** and **Hydro** to be applied to enemies with the goal of immobilizing them, making them unable to harm the player.

The Hydro character enables the freeze reaction and can be boosted by 15% Critical Rate from Cryo Resonance. These characters can either specialize in the 4 pc Heart of Depth set, or the 2 sets of Noblesse/Heart of Depth/Gladiator.&#x20;
